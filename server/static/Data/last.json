        "Damian hadn't returned the night before after their last interaction.",
        "\"Han said you were out doing battle last night,\" she said, noticing the shredded T-shirt on the floor.",
        "\"Did you win your battle last night?\" she asked as unease swept through her again.",
        "Claire was as beautiful as the last time he'd seen her.",
        "\"I see you remember the last time we met,\" she said, desire clouding her gaze.",
        "That's the last thing I need.",
