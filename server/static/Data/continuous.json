        "Relating to a line or curve that extends without a break or irregularity.",
        "A function in which changes, however small, to any x-value result in small changes to the corresponding y-value, without sudden jumps. Technically, a function is continuous at the point c if it meets the following condition: for any positive number ε, however small, there exists a positive number Δ such that for all x within the distance Δ from c, the value of f(x) will be within the distance ε from f(c). Polynomials, exponential functions, and trigonometric functions are examples of continuous functions.",

        "Without break, cessation, or interruption; without intervening time.\na continuous current of electricity",
        "Without intervening space; continued; protracted; extended.\na continuous line of railroad",
        "(botany) Not deviating or varying from uniformity; not interrupted; not joined or articulated.",
        "(analysis, of a function) Such that, for every x in the domain, for each small open interval D about f(x), there's an interval containing x whose image is in D.",
        "(mathematics, more generally, of a function) Such that each open set in the range has an open preimage.\nEach continuous function from the real line to the rationals is constant, since the rationals are totally disconnected.",
        "(grammar) Expressing an ongoing action or state.",
        "Continuous is stronger than continual. It denotes that the continuity or union of parts is absolute and uninterrupted, as in a continuous sheet of ice, or a continuous flow of water or of argument. So Daniel Webster speaks of \"a continuous and unbroken strain of the martial airs of England.\" By contrast, continual usually marks a close and unbroken succession of things, rather than absolute continuity. Thus we speak of continual showers, implying a repetition with occasional interruptions; we speak of a person as liable to continual calls, or as subject to continual applications for aid.",
