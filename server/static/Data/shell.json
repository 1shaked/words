        "A valuable product is a species of clam, the shell of which furnishes a specially iridescent mothero'-pearl, which the natives barter with the Japanese for inlaying lacquer.",
        "The characteristic organs of Mollusca are the mantle and shell, the foot, the ctenidia and the radula, of which all but the last are external.",
        "The external epithelium of the dorsal region secretes the shell.",
        "Between the edge of the shell and the foot there is a groove or cavity, chiefly developed laterally and posteriorly.",
        "The shell extends to the edge of the mantle-fold, and the cavity between the mantle and the side of the body is the pallial chamber.",
        "This chamber serves two purposes: it is primarily 18 the respiratory cavity containing the gills, but it also serves to enclose the body so that the latter is surrounded by the shell, from which the head and foot can be protruded at the will of the animal.",
        "The shell consists of an organic basis the substance of which is called conchiolin, impregnated with carbonate of lime, with a small proportion, I-2%, of phosphate of lime.",
        "On the outside of the shell is a non-calcified layer of conchiolin called the periostracum, secreted by the thickened edge of the mantle.",
        "The zone of the external surface of the mantle within the edge secretes a layer formed of prisms of calcite; the rest of the epithelium from this zone to the apex secretes the inner layer of the shell, composed of successive laminae; this is the nacreous layer, and in certain species has a commercial value as nacre or mother-of-pearl.",
        "Thus the growth of the shell in extent is due to additions to the prismatic layer at the edge, its growth in thickness to new layers of nacre deposited on its inner surface.",
        "In many cases in various classes the mantle is reflected over the edges of the shell, so as to cover more or less completely its outer surface.",
        "When this covering is complete the shell is contained in a closed sac and is said to be \" internal,\" but the sac is lined by ectoderm and the shell is always morphologically external.",
        "In one or two cases the epithelium of the foot secretes a calcified shell, which is either free as in Argonauta or adherent as in Hipponyx.",
        "sh, The shell.",
        "This ridge forms the edge of the shell-secreting epithelium, and therefore of the mantle, since the shell extends to the edge of the mantle.",
        "The veliger, as soon as its shell has attained some extent and begins to assume definite shape, is no longer of a form common to Mollusca generally, but acquires characters peculiar to the partiY cular class to which its parents belong.",
        "The metameric repetition of the shellplates and of the ctenidia are probably special modifications, but it is difficult to explain the spicules of the dorsal integument except as a condition more primitive than the shell itself.",
        "This has led to the loss of the radula, and is accompanied by the division of the shell into two valves.",
        "The peculiarities of the Gastropoda are all due to the torsion of the shell and body.",
        "Pieces of paper punctured with small holes are placed over the trays in which the hatching goes on; and the worms, immediately they burst their shell, creep through these openings to the light, and thereby scrape off any fragments of shell which, adhering to the skin, would kill them by constriction.",
        "The insects complete their cocoons in from three to four days, and in two or three days thereafter the cocoons are collected, and the pupa killed to prevent its further progress and the bursting of the shell by the fully developed moth.",

        "On the Tower of the Winds at Athens he is figured holding a shell, such as is blown by Tritons.",
        "With regard to natural products the country has few worth mentioning; minerals are found in the Lebanon, but not in any quantity; traces of amber-digging have been discovered on the coast; and the purple shell (murex trunculus and brandaris) is still plentiful.",

        "- Polyplacophora Each of the eight valves of the shell is made up of two distinct calcareous layers: (a) an outer or upper called the tegmentum, which is visible externally; (b) a deeper layer called articula FIG.",
        "It is the first part of the shell formed in development.",
        "The shell C .y Chaetoderma.",
        "This appears to indicate that the Neomeniomorpha are descended from Chiton-like ancestors, and that they have lost their shell valves.",
        "According to Paul Pelseneer the Polyplacophora are the most archaic, the Aplacophora being specialized in (1) the great reduction of the foot, (2) the disappearance of the shell (Cryptoplax among the Polyplacophora showing both reductions in progress), (3) the disappearance of the radula.",
        "the shell valves and the ctenidia.",
        "And although embryology seems to prove that the Neomeniomorphs are derived from forms with a series of shell-valves, nevertheless it seems probable that the calcareous spicules which alone are present in adult Aplacophora preceded the solid shell in evolution.",
        "The process therefore is so managed that only the outer shell of the casting is chilled, and that the interior remains graphitic, i.e.",
        "B, Main shell.",
