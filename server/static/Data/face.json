        "She glanced up at his tortured face and had to smile.",
        "The extra color was beginning to fade from his face and he turned toward the family room.",
        "His eyes twinkled with mirth, but he refused to let the rest of his face respond.",
        "She knew her face was getting red.",
        "She chanced a glance at his face, but he was contemplating the ladder.",
        "She tossed her head to throw the curls from her face and rolled over in bed.",
        "He reached out and brushed her hair away from her face.",
        "She made a face and he smiled.",
        "Cynthia fairly leaped away from Cade, her face flaming.",
        "His face was pale and drawn as he shoved the range back into place.",
        "He glanced up sharply, his lips thinning down and his face paling.",
        "She swung hard and her open hand cracked against his face.",
        "He brushed the hair back from her face and stroked her cheek gently.",
        "She buried her face in his shoulder, hoping he wouldn't notice she was crying.",
        "He lifted her chin with two fingers, and the expression on his face might have been amusing under different circumstances.",
        "In her bathroom, she wiped her face with a cold rag and took a couple of aspirin.",
        "She leaned forward to examine his face, but his expression told her nothing.",
        "Half an hour later, her eyes swollen and her chest sore from sobbing, she turned her face up to the warm water in the shower.",
        "Cade was standing over her, a puzzled expression on his face as he contemplated her work.",

        "Cynthia dropped to the couch and held the cool rag to her face as a new wave of nausea clutched her stomach.",
        "Cynthia removed the rag from her face and stared at her friend.",
        "Cynthia clamped the rag to her face again.",
        "His voice was low and she was sure no one else heard, but her face burned furiously.",
        "She glanced up at him, her face burning again.",
        "She gazed up into his face.",
        "His face was a road map of emotion, traveling from puzzled, to comprehensive and then on to frustration.",

        "Out of the corner of my eye, I was surprised to notice a strange look on Martha's face.",

        "My heart was in my mouth and I saw fear on Martha's face.",
        "As soon as the mother entered the house, he pocketed the phone, scaled the fence at a low corner, crossed to the surprised boy in a few steps, and placed a rag over his face.",
        "I don't know how the others kept a straight face but I pulled out a handkerchief, pretending to blow my nose.",
        "Julie maintained no Face Book or Twitter account, nor could Betsy locate her on any other social network sites.",
        "Successes were limited for the week with one found child, accidently trapped in a locked room of an empty house and one spousal abduction, in the face of a restraining order.",
        "His face brightened to a smile.",
        "He got in her face.",

        "When I made a face, she said, \"It gets better after you've had a few.\"",
        "When I returned to my office, Betsy met me, a frown on her face.",
        "Betsy pivoted around, wipeing her face, and hugged her.",
        "\"Yes,\" she said, with a hint of do-you-think-I'm-stupid look on her face.",
        "He was wearing a shirt and his unfastened necktie was hanging in my face.",
        "I tried to say more but she put her finger to my lips as she wiped her face.",
        "It was apparent by the look on Jackson's face.",
        "Jackson read the shocked look on my face.",
        "Now you have Julie, a nice home and a future looking you in the face.",
        "The look of shock on Betsy's face was immediately picked up by Molly and frightened the young girl.",
        "I served my time, all twelve years, three months and sixteen days of it, but it pales in the face of suffering I poured on these young ladies.",
        "he said, a baffled look on his face.",
        "My specially soaked rag was secure in a plastic bag so I withdrew it and had it over the child's face before she turned to see who entered.",
        "Nauseous from panic, I elbowed my way close enough to see a female figure, her face covered with an oxygen mask.",
        "I could feel tears streaming down my face though I had no recollection of generating them.",
        "I'm sure Howie must have known by the look on my face my news wouldn't be favorable.",
        "A stocky man with a baseball cap visor obscuring most of his face carried Molly in his arms.",
        "It was then I came to realize he killed in the dark, not face to face with his victim.",
        "I could tell by the look on his face, he'd had no such thought.",
        "I said as I cleaned my face and staggered to my feet.",
        "His face didn't look rubbery like a Halloween mask, but he didn't look normal.",
        "He had Papaw's face, with wrinkles around his eyes and a kind smile.",
        "The pale, dark-haired youth was drenched, but it was the wild look on his face that made her stop in the middle of the foyer and watch him pace with agitated energy.",
        "She didn't see her brother's bleached hair and familiar face anywhere in the crowd.",
        "He rubbed his face and crossed to the bathroom.",
        "The man was in his prime with silver hair and dark eyes, a handsome face, and a body as muscular as Talon's.",
        "She landed on a topless bottle of oil and spit the fluid out as it sprayed across her face.",
        "Tears wetted her face as men in what looked like black tactical SWAT gear entered the garage.",
        "The only skin not covered was his face and part of his neck, both of which were channeled and knotted by scars.",
        "With a deep breath, she opened the door, uncertain what horror she'd face next.",
        "She turned to face him, surprised to find the man who'd almost killed her earlier.",
        "His cheekbones were high, his chiseled face matching the chiseled body.",
        "She felt his cold gaze and didn't face him, cringing instead.",
        "He tucked the phone away and met her gaze, watching the emotions that crossed her face.",
        "Jonny sensed him as well and looked up, confusion and fear crossing his face.",
        "\"I'm so sorry,\" Jonny said, horror crossing his face.",
        "The young man's face paled even more, until he was as white as his bleached hair.",
        "Her cheek was red as if she'd been struck, and there were tears on her face already.",
        "Her face was white, her eyes glassy.",
        "He smoothed her hair from her face and rested his hand against the soft skin of her exposed thigh, admiring her body.",
        "There were tears on her face, and her breathing was shallow and ragged.",
        "She wiped her face and returned to her side.",
        "When he didn't, she rubbed her face, wondering what exactly she'd been dragged into and if her heart would explode if he reappeared.",
        "He rubbed his face.",
        "She smelled of her own musk, strands of hair escaping her braid to tickle his face.",
        "Her eyes sparkled again, her face glowing.",
        "\"I don't do one night stands, Dusty,\" she said, face red again.",
        "He hadn't thought it as harsh as it was, just like he thought nothing of killing anything in his path, but seeing the look on a normal human's face reminded him he'd been close to losing what humanity he possessed for quite a while.",
        "Her words followed him, and he rubbed his face.",
        "\"I hope it's soon,\" she said, a look of longing crossing her face.",
        "He peeled off a glove to display a hand as scarred as his face.",
        "\"Do my face!\" he said, excited.",
        "She scooted forward and placed her hands on either side of his face.",
        "He touched his face, tumultuous emotions crossing his face.",
        "She looked up at him, touched, as he felt his face again.",
        "He touched his face again then rubbed the back of his head.",
        "He looked up, a surprised expression crossing his face, as if he'd told her something he wasn't supposed to.",
        "Both breathed hard, and she noticed a red slash across Darian's face.",
        "He sat on the floor, hands covering his face, while Dusty stood.",
        "She looked away fast for fear of the sizzling blue gaze and dropped to her knees in front of Darian, pulling his hands from his face to see the wound.",
        "She gazed at him, lips parted and face flushed.",
        "They both tiptoed around the sexual attraction between them, and her face was flushed again.",
        "The man's face was red with shame this time.",
        "A look of anguish crossed Jonny's face.",
        "His last words were whispered, his face red.",

        "Anger and terror were on his face.",
        "His anger faltered, and sorrow filled his face.",
        "His eyes were wiser, his face firmer with few signs of the troubled youth she remembered.",
        "Startled, Bianca turned to face the doorway, recognizing the petite blonde woman who saved her from Dusty's bullet in Talon's garage.",
        "He touched her automatically, stroking the side of her face and tucking errant curls behind her ear.",
        "He took her face in his hands and drew her to him, kissing her once again.",
        "She touched his face, then his hair, her cool power soothing him.",
        "She placed her hands on her face and winced as Sofi vacuumed her power as Darian had.",
        "His golden gaze was down, turmoil on his face.",
        "Dusty braced himself and turned to face the grandfatherly figure with a smile and emerald eyes standing in the corner.",
        "He'd felt funky for a while, since Bianca fixed his face.",
        "He was normal, aside from the weird buzz at the base of his skull that'd kept him awake every night since Bianca touched his face.",
        "Talon's flush grew darker beneath the red of exertion on his face.",
        "It was a man too familiar to be a stranger, with beautiful purple eyes, a small frame, and a face without emotion.",
        "He replaced his weapons and washed his face, feeling very much like this was to be his last day alive.",
        "He turned to see the young man's face flushed this time with anger, his eyes glittering.",
        "Dusty looked from Darian's hopeful face to Jonny's pale and sullen features.",
        "As if noticing him for the first time, Darian stared at Bianca's brother, an odd look crossing his face.",
