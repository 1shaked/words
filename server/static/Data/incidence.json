        "Examining the light reflected from the windows of the Luxemburg palace with a doubly refracting prism, he was led to infer (though more refined experiments have shown that this is not strictly the case) that light reflected at a certain angle, called the polarizing angle, from the surface of transparent substances has the same properties with respect to the plane of incidence as those of the ordinary stream in Iceland spar with respect to the principal plane of the crystal.",
        "Thus in accordance with the definition, it is polarized in the plane of incidence.",
        "Further, if polarized light fall at the polarizing angle on a reflecting surface, the intensity of the reflected stream depends upon the azimuth of the plane of incidence, being proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle between this plane and the plane of the polarization.",
        "At angles other than the polarizing angle common light gives a reflected stream .that behaves as a mixture of common light with light polarized in the plane of incidence, and is accordingly said to be partially polarized in that plane.",
        "The refracted light, whatever be the angle of incidence, is found to be partially polarized in a plane perpendicular to the plane of incidence, and D.",
        "Arago showed that at all angles of incidence the reflected and refracted streams contain equal quantities of polarized light.",
        "It follows then that if a stream of light be incident at the polarizing angle on a pile of parallel transparent plates of the same nature, each surface in turn will be met by the light at the polarizing angle and will give rise to a reflected portion polarized in the plane of incidence.",
        "Fhe polarization of the light transmitted by the pile is never complete, but tends to become more nearly so as the number of the plates is increased and at the same time the angle of incidence for which the polarization is a maximum approaches indefinitely the polarizing angle (Sir.",
        "When light from an extended source is made to converge upon the crystal, the phenomenon of rings and brushes localized at infinity is obtained.The exact calculation of the intensity in this case is very complicated and the resulting expression is too unwieldy to be of any use, but as an approximation the formula for the case of a parallel beam may be employed, the quantities and p therein occurring being regarded as functions of the angle and plane of incidence and consequently as variables.",
        "The determination of the curves of constant retardation depends upon expressing the retardation in terms of the optical constants of the crystal, the angle of incidence and the azimuth of the plane of incidence.",
        "This was supplied by Fresnel, who, starting from a mechanical hypothesis, showed by ingenious but not strictly dynamical reasoning that if the incident stream have unit amplitude, that of the reflected stream will be - sin (i - r) /sin (i -{- r) or tan (i - r) /tan (i -{- r), according as the incident light is polarized in or perpendicularly to the plane of incidence i, r, being the angles of incidence and refraction connected by the formula sin i =,u sin r.",
        "At normal incidence the intensity of the reflected light, measured by the square of the amplitude, is { (µ -1) /(µ+ I) } 2 in both cases; but whereas in the former the intensity increases uniformly with i to the value unity for i =90°, in the latter the intensity at first decreases as i increases, until it attains the value zero when i -Fr = 90°, or tan i =,u - the polarizing angle of Brewster - and then increases until it becomes unity at grazing incidence.",
        "If the incident light be polarized in a plane, making an angle a with the plane of incidence, the stream may be resolved into two that are polarized in the principal azimuths, and these will be reflected in accordance with the above laws.",
        "Hence if 1 3 be the angle between the plane of incidence and that in which the reflected light is polarized tan (3= - tan a cos (i+r)/cos (i - r).",
        "104) has, however, shown that the polarization of the light from the sky can only be explained on the elastic solid theory by Fresnel's hypothesis of a different density, and from the study of Hertzian oscillations, in which the direction of the electric vibrations can be a priori assigned, we learn that when these are in the plane of incidence there is no reflection at a certain angle, so that the electric force is perpendicular to the plane of polarization.",
        "In the contrary case, total reflection commences as soon as sin i =µ 1, µ being still the relative refractive index of the more highly refracting medium; and for greater angles of incidence r becomes imaginary.",
        "Applying this interpretation to the formulae given above, it follows that when the incident light is polarized at an azimuth a to the plane of incidence and the second medium is the less refracting, the reflected light at angles of incidence exceeding the critical angle is elliptically polarized with a difference of phase A between the components polarized in the principal azimuths that is given by tan (A/2) =cot i l l (1 - µ 2 cosec 2 i).",
        "Thus A is zero at grazing incidence and at the critical angle, and attains its maximum value 7r-4 tan1 (I/p) at an angle of incidence given by sin e i=2/(p.2+I).",
        "Thus if A = 42, p. must exceed 7r/8 or 2.414, that is, the substance must be at least as highly refracting as a diamond: if A =7 /4, µ must be greater than 37r/16 or 1.4966, and when this is the case, it is possible by two reflections to convert into a circularly polarized stream a beam of light polarized at 45° to the plane of incidence.",
        "Wernicke and others have established that in general light polarized in any but the principal azimuths becomes elliptically polarized by reflection, the relative retardation of phase of the components polarized in these azimuths becoming 42 at a certain angle of incidence, called the principal incidence.",
        "In some cases it is the component polarized in the plane of incidence that is most retarded and the reflection is then said to be positive: in the case of negative reflection the reverse takes place.",
