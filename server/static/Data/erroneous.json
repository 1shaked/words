        "But Peel lived to make ample and honourable amend for this unfortunate ebullition, for not only did he \"fully and unequivocally withdraw the imputation which was thrown out in the heat of debate under an erroneous impression,\" but when the great free-trade battle had been won, he took the wreath of victory from his own brow, and placed it on that of his old opponent, in the following graceful words: - \"The name which ought to be, and will be associated with the success of these measures, is not mine, or that of the noble Lord (Russell), but the name of one who, acting I believe from pure and disinterested motives, has, with untiring energy, made appeals to our reason, and has enforced those appeals with an eloquence the more to be admired because it was unaffected and unadorned; the name which ought to be chiefly associated with the success of these measures is the name of Richard Cobden.\"",
