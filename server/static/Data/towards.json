        "Elisabeth started towards her.",

        "She padded towards her desk, where the Undersecretary of Domestic Security's electronic records were maintained within a secured, portable vault the size of her hand.",

        "She started towards the forest hedging the road adjacent to the condo community.",
        "\"We thought we'd start at Lana's house,\" Elise said as they all walked towards the awaiting helo.",
        "A military transport rolled from the main road leading out of the forest a few hundred meters away towards the town.",
        "Groups of people milled and moved towards the fields surrounding the town, guided by moonlight and the light of handheld lanterns.",

        "Dan bypassed the mansion and led him towards the lake, where two forms stood on a large dock.",
        "\"But Rhyn – \" Rhyn released him and walked away again, towards the tent where Kris was staying.",
        "He pulled up the hood and strode into the forest, towards the castle.  Beneath the hood, he took in the numbers of demons present.  There weren't as many as he expected but far more than he could fight without his magic.",
        "His anger growing at the petite woman who'd taken Andre, Katie and Gabe from him, Rhyn stalked towards the door.",
        "Follow this path until you reach a stream.  Follow the stream towards the smaller moon.  I'll catch up with you.  Whatever you do, don't leave the stream.",
        "The water looked … black in the moonlight.  She took a step back and looked up towards the moons.  As Gabriel indicated, one moon was lower than the other.",
        "She turned to see him motion her towards the jungle surrounding the lake.  His clothing was torn, and blood stained his skin.  He appeared to have been running; his boots were covered in mud that had splashed to his thighs, and his face was flushed.",
        "The specter pointed back towards the lake.  Katie slowed and watched Gabriel continue onward.  She'd liked Andre above any of the Council members, but his insistence that she go in the direction opposite of which she was headed puzzled her.",
        "Rhyn squinted towards the sound of his brother's voice, struggling to balance the sensations within him.",
        "\"It's not that,\" Kris said with an irritated glance towards his brother.  \"Kiki, I know none of you have faith in me.  I'm trying to do what's right, and you fight me all the way.\"",
        "They walked towards the beach that had formed his prison for three days in the real world.",
        "The crack grew fast, flying down the trail towards Gabriel.  The sound of the earth tearing grew louder.  The trees on either side of her expanded, quickly doubling and then quadrupling in size.  Afraid of being crushed between them, Katie darted off the trail towards Andre, who ran ahead of her.",
        "The two trees whose girth had been small enough for her wrap her arms around had expanded in width and height, reaching towards the gray sky of the underworld.  Katie craned her neck, unable to see the tops of the trees.  Their trunks had grown outward from the trail until they were as wide as a football field.  Their massive roots ruptured the ground that had been the trail, creating a ravine she could see even from their safe distance.",
        "\"We're going towards the lake,\" she said.",
        "Katie looked over her shoulder again towards the massive trees.  She didn't know what happened with Gabriel, but she hoped he was safe, wherever he was.",
        "He motioned dismissively towards the cell block.",
        "His walk turned to a trot and then a run.  Rhyn ran after him, feeling alive as they raced through the enchanted forest towards a fate he wasn't entirely certain how to handle yet.",
        "Toby asked as they walked towards a glowing portal.",
        "\"Up, above the tree line,\" Toby said, stretching towards the next one.",
        "Katie angled herself towards the voice once again.  The woman was close.  She continued and then stopped suddenly, nearly tripping over the small form in her path.",
        "She sat heavily, inching towards the other woman for warmth.",
        "\"This way,\" he said and started towards Death's palace.",
        "Demons flew towards him.",
        "The Ully-demon launched towards him.  The tree snatched Toby and lifted him to safety, and Toby dangled far enough over Ully's head that the demon couldn't reach him.  As he watched, the Ully-demon transformed into its natural form, a creature of wings, talons, and teeth longer than Toby's fingers.",
        "He flew through the air, drawing the attention of nearby demons in midflight.  He saw them shift directions and dart towards him just before he dipped beneath the jungle canopy again.",
        "Even the thunder of the underworld sounded weird.  Katie glanced towards the sky, silently cursing the rain.  She made her way over a fallen log and waited for Deidre before continuing.",
        "Kris and Kiki both looked towards the sky when the thunder began.  They'd both given their jackets to Hannah, whose step was growing slower the farther they went into the jungle.  Kiki muttered but didn't openly bitch, probably knowing Kris had no patience for anyone insulting his mate.",
        "Kris addressed Kiki with a worried look towards Hannah.",
        "She didn't look convinced.  Kris moved away her, his anxiety and concern growing.  They'd come there to rescue one human and might just lose two.  He paced and gazed up the tree, unable to see Kiki.  He heard Hannah stir and glanced towards her.  She rose from her seat.",
        "Kris looked up in time to see Kiki crash through the canopy and plummet towards the ground.  Kris gasped and sprung forward.  A streak of black crossed his vision as a flying demon snatched Kiki out of the air.",
        "Suddenly, Hannah stopped.  Kris barreled towards her.  He glimpsed movement before he burst into the small clearing.  It wasn't until he leapt over the final hurdle – a massive fallen tree – did he see what stopped her.  One moment she stood with her back to him.  The next, she was on the ground, Rhyn's dagger dripping with blood.",
        "Deidre screamed, and Katie twisted in midair.  The woman was tumbling towards the treetops.  Branches snatched at her and missed, and Deidre fell through the canopy to the jungle below.",
        "\"Gabe!\" the angel cried.  Katie pressed back against the wall of the palace.  The demons gathered around them, and she saw the flash of Gabe's weapons as he tried to cut a path through the creatures towards them.  The death-dealer went down as three demons dog-piled him.",
        "\"She'll be killed!\" she exclaimed, watching a disheveled Deidre march from the forest towards them.",
        "Suddenly, Deidre's vague story of lost love and Gabe's bitterness towards her clicked.",
        "He tugged her towards the portal.  \"Everyone has to deal with Death on their own.  Please, pleeeeeeease come with me, Mama!  We have to take you to the Sanctuary.  You're still not alive or dead yet.  We have to make you alive.\"",
        "\"Back to the palace,\" Rhyn said with a glance towards the dark sky.  It was the last day he could press Death for a favor.",
        "Death lowered the hand displaying the end of the world scenario.  The images of Gabe fighting demons switched to those of Katie on the beach under the moonlight.  Rhyn's breath caught at the sight of her.  She appeared exhausted, tattered, and drenched from the underworld rain.  She'd never looked as beautiful as she did, even if she looked as if she'd just left the underworld.  Toby was with her, pulling her from the beach towards the Sanctuary.",
        "And get rid of the demons.  And with that, she strode past them both, towards the door.",
        "He hefted Kiki once again.  Hannah sniffled and crawled to her feet.  Rhyn hurried towards the Sanctuary, concerned for Kiki but even more anxious about making sure Katie was alive and well.",
        "\"I told you I'd get you back,\" he said and took a step towards her.",
        "Everything was a struggle, and life in general wasn't heading towards her goal.",
        "He reached out and gently took her arm, pulling her towards him.",
        "Darian glanced towards his closest friend.",
        "Darian started towards the palace, intending to take her to bed with him once more before he started his official duties.",
        "One of the Guardians stepped towards him.",
        "Jenn's gaze went towards the main room of the dwelling.",
        "Jenn glanced towards them.",
        "She hurried to her feet and continued, heart racing as she ran through the city towards her home.",
        "He didn't go the way they did but cut through an alley towards the center of the city.",
