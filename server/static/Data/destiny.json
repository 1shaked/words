        "Carmen gazed down at Destiny inside the oxygen tent.",
        "Destiny probably wouldn't wake before they returned, and even if she did, Señor Medena would keep her occupied.",

        "He's watching Destiny right now.",
        "He said Destiny's fever had broken and if she continued to improve, they would take the tent off her bed in a few days.",

        "Katie arrived an hour later to pick up Jonathan and Destiny, and thirty minutes later Carmen and Alex were in the car headed for the airport.",
        "We didn't have Jonathan when he was an infant, and there was so much sadness at the time Destiny was born.",
        "Was what she felt for Gabriel nothing more than destiny and Immortal laws she knew nothing about?",
        "Why try to help her, if he knew her destiny already?",
        "Darkyn's assertions about her destiny being with him left her in a foul mood.",
        "In truth, destiny is like the web of a black widow.",
        "\"At least I can save other women from that destiny,\" she said.",
        "How did she accept her destiny as his mate?",
        "\"Up until today, I wasn't convinced that this might have been destiny from the beginning,\" she began.",
        "Knowing what she did now about her destiny, would she have sought out a deal with Darkyn?",
        "Deidre was being asked by the woman who stole her lover and her destiny for advice.",
        "This time, there was nothing else standing between her and her destiny.",
        "In the course of three days, the goddess had almost learned to see him as an equal while her human side no longer in denial about her destiny.",
        "He lifted Destiny from the rug in her room where she had fallen asleep and gently placed her in her bed.",
        "Destiny would be two years old before long.",
        "He picked up the toys Destiny had been playing with and put them in the toy box.",
        "Carmen pitched the disposable diaper in the trash and hefted Destiny from the changing table.",
        "Destiny was big for her age.",
        "Destiny was born less than a week after Josh died.",
        "Alex and Carmen were the only parents Destiny had ever known.",
        "Unlike Jonathan, though, Destiny had natural grandparents to spoil her – and they did.",
        "Josh was gone now, and Lori didn't want anything to do with Destiny.",
        "Focusing on the present, Carmen straightened Destiny's frilly yellow Easter dress and brushed the thumb from her mouth.",
        "Destiny stared up at her with big gray eyes that questioned her motive.",
        "Setting Destiny back on the changing table again, Carmen pushed a shoe back on her foot and tickled her under the arm.",
        "Destiny giggled, revealing top and bottom teeth in matching pairs.",
        "Destiny's eyes lit up.",
        "She smiled, remembering the day they took Destiny home from the hospital.",
        "Like her adoptive mother, Destiny was mesmerized by the chocolate gaze and rich deep voice.",
        "Alex had been so shocked when Carmen offered to take Destiny home unconditionally.",
        "Carmen lifted Destiny from the changing table again and turned as Alex walked into the room.",
        "Carmen forced her mind from dreamland again and stood Destiny on the floor.",
        "Alex was talking to someone in the living room as she led Destiny down the hallway.",
        "\"What's wrong?\" she asked as Destiny abandoned her hand and flung herself at him.",
        "Carmen's first impulse was to snatch Destiny back, but the six months waiting period had long passed.",
        "It was an open adoption and Lori had every right to see Destiny.",
        "When they entered the living room, Lori's full attention riveted on Destiny.",
        "After a moment, she stepped forward and held out her hands to Destiny.",
        "Destiny drew back, clutching Alex around the neck possessively as she stared at Lori.",
        "Lori's disappointed statement left the impression that she expected Destiny to know her.",
        "\"Destiny,\" Alex said, watching Lori expectantly.",
        "Jonathan was no more blood relation to them than Destiny, but neither child could have been loved more deeply nor considered more a family member.",
        "Alex tried to disentangle Destiny, but she held on tight and started to whine.",
        "He tried to shift Destiny so that he had an unobstructed view of Lori.",
        "He pealed Destiny from his neck and handed her to Carmen, his voice softening as he spoke to Destiny.",
        "Destiny let go of him and reluctantly transferred to Carmen.",
        "Carmen cuddled Destiny close while keeping her attention on Alex and Lori.",
        "Being wrong won't stop her from taking Destiny if she's determined, though.",
        "She agreed because she didn't want Destiny then.",
        "While Destiny could never take her place, she had filled the void.",
        "Deep inside, all she could think about was that Lori might want revenge more than she wanted Destiny.",
        "Her life revolved around Alex, Jonathan and Destiny.",
        "Alex and Bill had wandered off with Jonathan and the twins, as usual, which left Carmen with Katie and Destiny.",
        "\"I doubt she came back to get Destiny,\" Katie said.",
        "I imagine she figures if she gets Destiny, she'll get the farm and the insurance money.",
        "Poor Destiny will be left with nothing.",
        "If he had lived, maybe Lori would have kept Destiny.",
        "Carmen had worked with Josh's parents to reserve both the money and the farm for Destiny.",
        "Alex had already set aside a trust fund for both Jonathan and Destiny, and Carmen was listed as an equal partner in everything.",
        "Alex refused to let her attach his name to that, so she had made provisions for it to be left to Jonathan and Destiny.",
        "There were only three things that mattered to her – Alex, Jonathan and Destiny.",
        "The fact that Lori said she didn't want Destiny when she was born didn't mean that she wasn't feeling bad about it now.",
        "The lawyer assured Alex that Lori could not take Destiny from them at this point.",
        "And yet, in spite of her comment about only being there for a short time, Lori came back several times to visit Destiny.",
        "Destiny had finally reached the point that she would tolerate being held by Lori, but after a few minutes she was ready to get down or go to Alex, Carmen or Jonathan.",
        "Her focus right now seemed to be winning Destiny, but Destiny didn't warm to people easily.",
        "I wondered if I could get Destiny tomorrow.",
        "\"I'm sure Destiny will really enjoy it,\" Carmen said.",
        "Later that evening, Carmen was reading a book to Destiny and Jonathan was sprawled out on the window seat, reading a book about horses.",
        "Destiny gradually relaxed and Carmen stopped reading.",
        "His gaze shifted to Destiny and he placed the cup on the granite bar.",
        "Lifting Destiny into his arms, he gazed down at her sleeping face and smiled.",
        "Katie wants to keep Destiny today, so I'll drop her off and then take Jonathan to the school for his field trip when I go for the conference.",
        "Spooning eggs into a plate for Jonathan and a bowl for Destiny, she returned the pan to the stovetop.",
        "I'll go get Destiny ready while you eat.",
        "It took exactly one hour to take Destiny over to Katie's and drop Jonathan off at the school before meeting with his teacher.",
        "Carmen was waiting for Alex outside the clinic with Destiny one day when the red-headed man strolled up to the car.",
        "\"Let's not talk about it now, Carmen,\" he said, glancing at Destiny.",
        "Destiny is as much a part of me as she is of you.",
        "If Lori hadn't admitted that she loved Alex the day Destiny was born, the idea that the two of them were romantically involved probably wouldn't have crossed her mind.",
        "I can't let her take Destiny away from you.",
        "So in her eyes, I took Josh and you from her – and now Destiny.",
        "Maybe she'd like to take both you and Destiny away from me.",
        "She also must know why it was so important to him that she didn't take Destiny.",
        "If her present methods were not working, she might simply decide to take Destiny and run – if Destiny was what she wanted.",
        "Lori, I know I told you in the hospital that I would let you have Destiny when you were ready, but I hadn't talked to Alex about it yet.",
        "I was thinking about you then, not Alex or Destiny.",
        "She pulled in behind his truck and took Destiny out of the car.",
        "Destiny, giggling and ran at her side, caught up in the fun.",
        "\"Tickle her Destiny!\" he said.",
        "Destiny's little fingers wiggled on Carmen's ribs and she laughed.",
        "Destiny squealed with delight and did it again.",
        "We'll take care of Destiny.",
        "They were happy with each other, and whatever Destiny might have been born, she was a Barnett now.",
        "Glancing around to make sure Destiny was still safely in the little pen inside the barn, she pulled the phone from its holster on her side and called Alex.",
        "Lifting Destiny from the pen, she continued with the chores.",
        "She filled the feeder and let Destiny throw some grain through the fence.",
        "She squatted down to show it to Destiny.",
        "Destiny touched its soft furry body and stubby ears.",
        "The tiny pink nose wiggled and the pink eyes regarded Destiny suspiciously.",
        "Destiny giggled and looked up at Carmen.",
        "Back at the house, Carmen prepared the chicken for the oven while Destiny sat in her high chair playing with some cereal.",
        "When Alex came home for lunch, Carmen picked up Destiny and followed him to the barn.",
        "Why don't you call Mums and see if she'll watch Destiny?",
        "Carmen called Mums, who said she would come over and pick up Destiny.",
        "She offered to watch Destiny overnight and Alex said that might be a good idea.",
        "After lunch, Mums arrived to get Destiny.",
        "Destiny ran to her, excitedly.",
        "Destiny wasn't her only granddaughter, but all of the others were in their teens.",
        "Alex held his arms out to Destiny.",
        "Destiny leaned toward him and kissed him enthusiastically.",
        "Mums was still chuckling as she buckled Destiny into the car.",
        "On Saturday Carmen left Alex with Jonathan and Destiny, heading for the old house.",
        "Where are Jonathan and Destiny?",
        "Jonathan would stay with Katie for the night and the Reynolds would keep Destiny.",
        "Right now Destiny and Jonathan need someone strong to lean on.",
        "They still hadn't caught the red-headed man, but they had a regular patrol, so Carmen took Jonathan and Destiny home with her.",
        "As if they all didn't have enough to worry about, as soon as Carmen put Destiny down inside their home, she started calling for Alex.",
        "Jonathan tried to tell Destiny that Alex wasn't there, but she continued to look anyway.",
        "Only after both Destiny and Jonathan fell asleep did Carmen take her shower and go to bed.",
        "As May gave way to June, the lengthening daylight hours gave her more time to be with Jonathan and Destiny and still complete taking care of the animals before darkness.",
        "Each morning she took Jonathan to camp before dropping Destiny off at Katie's house and returning to the hospital.",
        "One night after chores, Carmen, Jonathan and Destiny were eating supper when Brutus started barking.",
        "Do you honestly think I'd send him into a place where Destiny was?",
        "Destiny stared up at her.",
        "She glanced at Destiny.",
        "None of this would get Destiny back.",
        "\"It wasn't Destiny,\" she said, and bit her lower lip.",
        "We all love Destiny so much and you knew we would provide a good home.",
        "A red-eyed Lori went out on the porch and talked to them while Carmen got Destiny ready for bed.",
        "Destiny reached for her and Lori took her, holding her close.",
        "Destiny wrapped her arms around Lori's neck.",
        "One day, when Destiny was with Grandma Reynolds and Jonathan was at staying with a friend, she decided to go down to the house before she went to the hospital.",
        "That night she and Jonathan picked up Destiny and then headed home.",
        "She could do nothing without endangering both Destiny and Jonathan.",
        "The only thing that kept her from breaking down was the fact that Jonathan and Destiny needed her.",
        "Destiny no longer mentioned Alex, and even Jonathan seemed resigned to living without him.",
        "Carmen left early to pick up Destiny so that Katie could go see Alex.",
        "The restraining order is for Destiny, not Alex.",
        "Destiny was sitting no more than five feet away now.",
        "Later, after Destiny fell asleep and Jonathan went to his room, Lori regarded her thoughtfully.",
        "That evening, when she picked Destiny and Jonathan up, Katie had an interesting perspective on the incident.",
        "I wonder what Destiny and Jonathan will think.",
        "And Destiny won't know what to think at first, but she will be delighted to have you home.",
        "Are you still worrying about Jonathan and Destiny?",
        "It's time to go get Destiny.",
        "Alex walked toward her and it was a minute before Destiny spotted him.",
        "Destiny stared at him for a minute, her expression unreadable.",
        "Destiny watched him warily, still clinging to Carmen.",
        "Destiny cowered against her, watching Alex intently.",
        "Destiny was in her high chair playing with fruit colored cereal.",
        "Neither of them acted like they noticed Destiny was there, and she only watched them, apparently unconcerned.",
        "Destiny squealed and when Alex turned to look at her, she lifted her arms for him to pick her up.",
        "While their relationship was strained, his relationship with Jonathan and Destiny had returned to normal.",
        "The meeting only lasted an hour, and when she returned, Destiny was taking a nap.",
        "By the time she finished showering and dressing, Alex had Destiny ready.",
        "Jonathan hurried off to bible class and it was Carmen's turn to help out with the infants, so she took Destiny with her.",
        "When they were getting ready to leave, Alex took Destiny from Carmen's arms and opened the door for her.",
        "With Destiny buckled in safely and Jonathan sitting beside her, he climbed behind the wheel and started the car.",
