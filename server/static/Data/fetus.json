        "During an external cephalic version (also known as version), the obstetrician attempts to turn the fetus to a head first position before labor begins by manipulating the outside of the abdomen.",
        "It may take several tries before the fetus cooperates, but about half will eventually turn.",
        "A version should only be done in a hospital, with an ultrasound machine used to guide the obstetrician in turning the fetus.",
        "The fetus should be monitored with a fetal monitor before and after the version.",
        "A version is not appropriate for every fetus who is in the breech position at the end of pregnancy.",
        "It can only be tried if there is one fetus in the uterus, if the placenta is not lying in front of the fetus, and if the umbilical cord does not appear to be wrapped around the fetus at any point.",

        "Retardation can also be caused by damage to the fetus during pregnancy due to alcohol, drug abuse or toxicity, and disorders of the developing nervous system such as hydrocephalus.",
        "However, those that arise from damage to the fetus due to the mother's use of drugs or alcohol during pregnancy can be prevented by avoiding these substances.",
        "Second, the onset of premature labor may be induced, in part, by complications that have already caused neurologic damage in the fetus.",
        "Studying prenatal human development is difficult because the embryo and fetus develop in a closed environment-the mother's womb.",

        "Prenatal surgery is a surgical procedure performed on a fetus prior to birth.",
        "This can cause the urine, which normally flows out into the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus, to back up and injure the kidneys.",
        "However, in addition to kidney damage, urinary tract obstructions can lead to multiple abnormalities and depleted amniotic fluid, which endangers the fetus and prevents the lungs from growing.",
        "About 10 percent of fetuses with urinary tract obstructions may require prenatal surgery in which a device is placed in the fetus's bladder to drain the urine into the amniotic sac.",
        "CCAMs also can push on the trachea and the esophagus where they prevent the fetus from ingesting amniotic fluid.",
        "The decision to have prenatal surgery is made on the basis of detailed ultrasound imaging of the fetus, including an echocardiogram that uses ultrasound to obtain images of the fetal heart, as well as other diagnostic tools.",
