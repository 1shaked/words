        "They heard the sudden twittering of a bird, but could not find the creature anywhere.",
        "As she watched, the creature rose and hobbled from the desk to a nearby shelf.",
        "This creature I'll avoid when I come calling, which I soon plan to do.",
        "You've always been a selfish creature, Jule.",
        "The Wizard reached out, caught the wee creature in his hand, and holding its head between one thumb and finger and its tail between the other thumb and finger he pulled it apart, each of the two parts becoming a whole and separate piglet in an instant.",
        "There was no way to get the creature out without breaking the vase, so the Tin Woodman smashed it with his axe and set the little prisoner free.",
        "The beautiful creature passed her hands over her eyes an instant, tucked in a stray lock of hair that had become disarranged, and after a look around the garden made those present a gracious bow and said, in a sweet but even toned voice:",
        "\"What a charming creature your younger girl is,\" said the visitor; \"a little volcano!\"",
        "At the far end of the library was a creature that made her think twice about entering.",
        "Today, she had left, because the idea of eternity in the red desert with a creature incapable of caring for her was too much for her to bear.",
        "The creature walking away from her wanted something, and she couldn't figure out what.",
        "In that moment, she almost felt a human connection to the creature with the red eyes.",
        "\"He's a creature that wriggles in anywhere!\" was the answer.",
        "Jule launched himself out the window as the creature made the second blow against the door.",
        "He is the same restless little creature he was when you saw him.",
        "He knew it was Napoleon--his hero--but at that moment Napoleon seemed to him such a small, insignificant creature compared with what was passing now between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it.",
        "Then, having tied the wooden creature securely, the boy buckled the strap and tossed his prisoner into the buggy.",
        "\"What an absurd creature!\" he exclaimed.",
        "A full head smaller than him, Darkyn was nonetheless the most lethal creature Gabriel had ever known.",
        "She, poor innocent creature, is left to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits.",
        "She couldn't help thinking the creature whose job it was to trick people into Hell wasn't above lying to the human mate he took.",
        "The horse had especially attracted their notice, because it was the biggest and strangest creature they had ever seen; so it became the center of their first attack.",
        "Unlike her father, this creature was capable of sympathy.",
        "Of course, you cannot help it, and I love you just as well as if you were the most beautiful creature in the world.",
        "It is hardly as if you had seen a wild creature when a rabbit or a partridge bursts away, only a natural one, as much to be expected as rustling leaves.",
        "Prince Andrew longed to snatch up, to squeeze, to hold to his heart, this helpless little creature, but dared not do so.",
        "She wasn't able to reconcile the creature that turned her Immortal with the man before her.",
        "\"You almost waited too long,\" the mysterious creature said from behind him.",
        "You've got about two minutes before this creature tears through me and kills you.",
        "The hair on the back of his neck rose, and he tensed, waiting for the creature to materialize.",
        "Had his actions truly set her on this path to end up as the plaything of a creature with no capacity for mercy?",
        "His eyes turned black, fathomless, and she knew whatever creature possessed the human body was loosening its grip on its powers.",
        "I would like to feel a parrot talk, it would be so much fun! but I would be pleased with, and love any little creature you send me.",
        "Dusty asked, eyes going from his dinner to the mangled creature on the table in front of them.",
        "Jim's eyes stuck out as much as those of the Sawhorse, and he stared at the creature with his ears erect and his long head drawn back until it rested against his arched neck.",
        "Long afterward James Hogg said, \"I never felt so grateful to any creature below the sun as I did to Sirrah that morning.\"",
        "You want me to find a creature with untold powers with my human self?",
        "The kind of creature that could do such things to other men left her no doubt he'd do the same to her if she didn't obey.",
        "He glanced once at the companion's face, saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him, and, as often happens when one is talking, felt somehow that this companion in the black dress was a good, kind, excellent creature who would not hinder his conversing freely with Princess Mary.",
        "I was no longer a restless, excitable little creature, requiring the attention of everybody on the train to keep me amused.",
        "There are many furrows in the sand where some creature has travelled about and doubled on its tracks; and, for wrecks, it is strewn with the cases of caddis-worms made of minute grains of white quartz.",
        "Speck was waiting for him, at his feet a creature Dusty couldn't identify.",
        "Dusty considered her before gazing back at the mutilated creature on top of the stainless steel lab counter.",
        "You are certainly the most beautiful creature I ever beheld.",
        "He sensed the creature ascend the stairs and chose a room at random, shoving it open with his hip.",
        "There was no way a creature like Darkyn, who valued control over everything, was going to let her talk to Zamon.",
        "The Other's bedchamber had been empty, as if the otherworldly creature was permanently gone.",
        "Jule wasn't lucky enough for the creature on the main floor not to hear.",
        "You'll be the one person in the universe who finds an ounce of good in that creature, Darkyn.",
        "He was the unpredictable, violent creature she always considered him in battle but not in dealing.",
        "I said a creature who has never known peace will surrender unconditionally when he tastes it for the first time.",
        "But they've been very scarce for a few years and we usually have to be content with elephants or buffaloes, answered the creature, in a regretful tone.",
        "What kind of creature would hurt a woman like this? her father asked.",
        "The parent will sometimes roll and spin round before you in such a dishabille, that you cannot, for a few moments, detect what kind of creature it is.",
        "As twenty years before, it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived somewhere under her heart would ever cry, suck her breast, and begin to speak, so now she could not believe that that little creature could be this strong, brave man, this model son and officer that, judging by this letter, he now was.",
        "Her astonishment, when she felt the tiny creature inside, cannot be put in a letter.",
        "If an ox were his property, and he wished to get needles and thread at the store, he thought it would be inconvenient and impossible soon to go on mortgaging some portion of the creature each time to that amount.",
        "I learned how the sun and the rain make to grow out of the ground every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, how birds build their nests and live and thrive from land to land, how the squirrel, the deer, the lion and every other creature finds food and shelter.",
        "\"You are the soul to a creature who had none,\" he said.",
        "Wynn wasn't about to ask why it was secret or spend too much time in Hell with the violent creature before him.",
        "That creature said: You are angry, you are jealous, you would like to pay him out, you are afraid--but here am I!",
        "When the people saw me come from the sky they naturally thought me some superior creature, and bowed down before me.",
        "And believe me, if I still value my life it is only because I still hope to meet such a divine creature, who will regenerate, purify, and elevate me.",
        "He looked closely at the creature.",
        "She started to shake, unable to bear the idea of more children dying or living with the creature behind it.",
        "Worse, she wasn't about to give the creature that tricked her into Hell and turned her Immortal an ounce of compassion.",
        "She was perplexed by this creature.",
        "\"Good enough,\" the creature down the hall, Jared, said with a loud sigh.",
        "This creature has been identified as a yellow baboon.",
        "Aside from its large, glowing green eyes, the creature appeared near-human with a lean body covered in some sort of leather jumper.",
        "The creature looked confused but shifted from its guarded crouch to a kneeling position.",
        "Though she tried hard not to fear death, she wondered what kind of creature was capable of breaking through bars made of materials she'd never before seen and held in place with some sort of magic.",
        "She relived the bloody scene in the banquet hall, heard the creature panting her name as he came against her thigh and then tore through the other side of her neck.",
        "She needed more rope to reach the top of the cliff, yet being dinner for any creature wasn't the way she'd like to go.",
        "Even without some sadistic creature's name around her neck, things would never be the same.",
        "Pain blazed through him as he took the shape of the ancient creature.",
        "He didn't understand why the self-proclaimed guardian of humans would drag such a helpless creature into this web of evil.",
        "\"There isn't a creature in this realm that talks to me like you do,\" Kris muttered.",
        "He wasn't a patient creature, whatever he was.",
        "She dropped, surprised and disgusted when one hand landed in what was a human or creature at one point.",
        "The tension in the room was high, each creature bristling with magic.",
        "After Hans ' death is fully avenged the creature jumps from a cliff to her death.",
        "I have no mercy for any creature that preys on humans.",
        "She held her breath, not wanting to draw the attention of either creature.",
        "The creature's emerald eyes stopped sparkling, and his face grew long.",
        "Knowing the most powerful creature – one the Dark One himself exiled at one point for his ruthlessness – had taken over Hell was another matter entirely.",
        "Deidre crossed to him, unafraid of the creature whose appearance often made grown Immortals quake and grovel.",
        "Gabriel watched her, wanting to verify that she didn't fear the creature she was trapped with.",
        "Your tears would never stop if you were faced with the creature you were.",
        "Lean and youthful, he was unthreatening in appearance but the single most lethal creature Gabriel knew.",
        "No part of her was ready to meet whatever creature they discussed.",
        "She looked him over, silently dismissing any notion that this creature spent much time in the mortal world.",
        "There had to be more to what this creature offered.",
        "He'd given her something to think about, but her instincts were screaming at her not to have anything to do with this creature.",
        "The demons they passed bowed to Darkyn, their eyes riveted to her once the scary creature strode by.",
        "The scraping of leather against leather, the hollow clatter of stone and shale, the rustle of whatever creature settled behind her.",
        "Near full-blown panic again, Deidre was midway through her second step towards the door when the creature snatched her.",
        "The creature took a sip of her like from a straw.",
        "The creature's third sip drove her into the darkness between consciousness and sleep.",
        "Deidre was still as the creature walked around her, scrutinizing her.",
        "Its colors rippled and changed before the flower bent and delicate wings spread apart, revealing a creature that was surely a fairy.",
        "A human-like creature sat in the corner making snorting sounds he assumed was weeping.",
        "The sobbing, slender creature tensed and covered his head, as if expecting an attack from above.",
        "Amused, Rhyn stopped pacing and sat, staring the small creature down.",
        "Death had her pick of badasses from every generation of man and creature, and she wooed every one with the promise of endless riches and the ability to leave when they chose.",
        "She watched as the creature neared in the shadowy darkness.",
        "Her eyes stayed on the creature, which joined several more tattooed beings in the hall before they all struck out in different directions.",
        "Her blurred vision fell to the corner, where a creature with glowing emerald eyes crouched.",
        "\"You brought much blood,\" the creature said, its voice trembling a little with excitement.",
        "\"What are you?\" the creature asked.",
        "It was egregious that stores of immense power were wasted on such a creature at a time when Damian needed all the help he could get.",
        "Raised by a sadistic Other who beat her, the Magician Yully had used the magic of all of them to kill the creature that planned to use her to sever the boundary between mortal and immortal worlds before wiping out Watchers and humans.",
        "Why else would they want Jenn, if not because they'd seen her name written as the mate of the one creature who could prevent them from executing goals as mysterious as those of the Watchers?",
        "The hibernating creature within her shook itself awake and began crawling through her blood.",
        "You must avoid mixing your blood with his and kill any whose does, or the creature will continue to destroy your people.",
        "The words of Tiyan's warlords yearned to be read, their lesson clear: the creature was no ally of man.",
        "She knew she was damned and wasn't willing to condemn anyone else with the creature in her blood.",
        "To invite a creature like that into the heart of Tiyanâ€¦there is no evil that cannot corrupt!",
        "How the warlords ever thought this creature would save themâ€¦",
        "I'm an Oracle, a creature from the human realm who has the ability to see the future.",
        "Eden's attention shifted from the blood-soaked city to the creature beside her.",
        "Because apparently, to humans, explosions were more interesting than the fact they were watching him â€“ a creature that hunted humans â€“ cook their food.",
        "If Jonny was some sort of freaky vampire and wasn't willing to face Xander to get the necklace, did that mean Xander was some sort of â€¦ creature, too?",
        "Something told her that the interest of a man â€¦ creature like him was not a good thing.",
        "The Oracle told my mother that she wanted to turn me into a creature beyond mercy with power no one could counter.",
        "There is no mercy or compassion in this creature.",
        "He wrapped his arms around the creature protectively, not about to let it go until every last drop of blood was gone.",
        "Jule felt the creature's presence disappear and dwelled on the odd arrangement.",
        "Jule smiled despite his unease, not about to be caught off guard by the creature.",
        "The woman was far enough ahead she should be able to escape while he distracted the creature.",
        "\"Original Vamp,\" Jule said, barely registering the creature's words.",
        "She'd met enough Guardians and vamps to know how unique each was, but she'd never met a creature like this one.",
        "I can track any animal, any kind of creature.",
        "Sofi wasn't surprised to learn he was an Original Being and had known where to find this creature.",
        "She looked up, shocked to see Sasha standing over them, his sharp gaze on the creature preparing itself for a second attack.",
        "The treaty was hardly concluded when it was violated by the Porte, which refused to recognize the right of the Walachian boiars to elect their voivode, and nominated Alexander Ypsilanti, a creature of its own.",
        "Damian knew better than to trust the deceptive appearance of this type of creature.",
        "The creature that refused to bow down to the Dark One was not going to allow itself to become blood-dependent upon a mate of human origin.",
        "The creature repeated her name several more times while she examined her body.",
        "The creature across the hall growled.",
        "She didn't let herself think too much about what it might be, how she ended up in Hell, or why she'd just let some otherworldly creature with fuzzy hands cut off her clothes.",
        "The creature twisted her wrist and squeezed, capturing her blood in a small vial.",
        "A look of satisfaction spread over the face of the creature before her.",
        "Sasha was not a hard creature to understand.",
        "This time, Rhyn couldn't figure out why the creature wanted a human so badly he'd bring her here yet didn't seem eager about her becoming his mate.",
        "She'd never thought she'd find a reason to want some creature to suck her blood; if ever, now was the time.",
        "\"Vile creature,\" a cool, crisp voice said.",
        "She'd never thought a creature like him weak.",
        "Why would any Ancient creature choose me?",
        "Rhyn was a mass murderer, a creature who had tried to wipe out the human race.",
        "Other thoughts collided with her emotions, ones that reminded her that she was forever trapped with some otherworldly creature that viewed her as a food supply and nothing more.",
        "It was hard to reconcile the man before her with the creature that tore apart bodies like meat in a blender.",
        "He crossed his arms, aware she was the only creature not intimidated by his displays of strength.",
        "She didn't doubt that the only creature Rhyn would listen to was Gabriel, and that Gabriel had told him to leave her be.",
        "Her hands shook as she stood there discussing her own death with a creature that resembled the Grim Reaper.",
        "It stared at her through green eyes, and she frowned, uncertain why the sight of the creature bothered her.",
        "She recalled the scent of her blood, what hot agony felt like as an otherworldly creature tore her apart.",
        "Jared.s form contorted then grew twice his size as he shifted into a creature unlike any she.d ever seen.",
        "He knew Jared well enough after all their years in Hell together to understand the creature was too narcissistic to care about another.s issues.",
        "Rhyn studied the demon, aware he could never trust such a creature fully.",
        "Each one represented a millennium, and this creature had been around longer than Rhyn.s deceased brother, Andre.",
        "He tossed the creature to the side for later and shifted into his human form.",
        "She stood and crossed to the scared creature and took one of his soft hands.",
        "There was no way in Hell Kris would give this creature the key",
        "Jade couldn.t help the flash of anger he felt at the sight of such a creature comfortable and content.",
        "A massive creature with black fur and fangs paused in front of the open door, sniffing the air.",
        "It slammed the creature onto a broken piece of burning word.",
        "The dying creature let out an otherworldly roar of pain as it burned.",
        "The remaining creature turned to them.",
        "Jared morphed again into a massive creature.",
        "Rhyn was the first to engage any demon in his way while Tamer and Erik beheaded every creature that crossed their paths.",
        "He didn.t want to agree to Rhyn.s terms, but the side of him willing to take in a creature like Sasha emerged again.",
        "She turned to face the creature who.d been stalking her in her dreams.",
        "She wanted nothing to do with anything from Hell, especially this creature.",
        "Rhyn took the small creature under one arm.",
        "Pretty for so small a creature.",
        "The room was vacant except for a metal slab that served as a bed and the six-legged, cat-like creature sitting on the edge of the bed watching its sleeping occupant.",
        "It didn't spin webs and looked more to Evelyn like a mutated cat, but the moment she recalled Kiera's fear, she also realized that the cat-like creature would easily pass as a large spider.",
        "She grabbed the sitting creature.",
        "She tucked the creature in her hands under one arm and left the small room for a long corridor in similar dark grey which glowed more brightly from indistinguishable light sources.",
        "The cat-like creature squirmed.",
        "The creature loped ahead, darting out of sight down another hall.",
        "She tugged the top of the kitchen table to block the doorway, hoping it would keep the creature in the kitchen.",
        "She leaned the broom against the wall, unhappy to see the creature but feeling bad for it.",
        "Meanwhile Donnie and Martha, with Cynthia's help, tried to revive the mortally wounded creature but the prognosis was not good.",
        "The frightened creature is as ill prepared for the season as I and scurries about frantically in the deepening snow in search of sustenance.",
        "Lucky me, another creature of nobility.",
        "This was not a mangy or vicious creature standing before him, but a breathtakingly beautiful, gigantic wolf.",
        "I've known you longer than any creature still in existence.",
        "He said nothing, aware the creature before him wasn't capable of communicating a truth in a way most others could understand.  Death was from a time before time.  He would never understand what she saw when she looked out over humanity and saw its Past, Present, Future, and the soul of each human that ever lived.  The size of her vision rendered her unique interpretations puzzling, even to him.",
        "She's a conniving, self-serving, arrogant creature.  Heartless, too.",
        "You're a smart creature, Ully.",
        "Rhyn crept carefully through the demon scouts positioned throughout the forest surrounding the castle.  The demons wore the Dark One's uniform of all black with waterproof cloaks and hoods.  The demon side of him rendered his presence similar enough to a full-demon's that the others wouldn't be alarmed.  He sized up each demon he passed, until he found one who appeared to be his size.  The creature didn't hear his soft step, and the snapping of the demon's neck was the only other sound in the falling rain.",
        "I see nothing but Gabriel's human weakness for a creature he should've let die-dead.",
        "He ascended two floors to the hallway where Kris's supplies had been stocked.  He recalled how hard it could be taking care of a helpless creature like Katie or Toby.  He strode to the chamber that had served as a department store full of clothing to Kris's Immortals.  Not surprised to find the chamber ransacked, he sifted through the remaining clothing on the floor.  He guessed Toby's size and stuffed a bag with a few items before going to the food supplies.",
        "Rhyn asked, irritated by the helpless creature.",
        "She sped up, and so did the creature.  Katie stopped fast.  The shadow Immortal stopped with her.",
        "Katie hesitated then continued onto the path Gabriel had told her to follow.  She didn't know what the creature was.  He looked like Andre, but Andre was dead-dead, which meant the creature following them was something else.",
        "While not large, the Immortal underworld was separated by several different domains, two of which – Hell and Death's domain - were contained within shields no one could enter.  At least, no normal Immortal or demon could enter.  As a creature of both worlds, Rhyn could enter Hell, and he'd found by visiting Gabe that he was able to enter Death's domain, too.",
        "If he was dead-dead, what creature wanted her to go elsewhere and why?  If he wasn't dead-dead, why didn't he speak to her?",
        "Rhyn said nothing, aware the creature before him couldn't be trusted anymore than Death.",
        "\"Every man, woman, and creature knows suffering, Rhyn,\" Kiki said.",
        "Rhyn smiled faintly, admiring the woman before him.  She was foolishly stubborn and lippy – and he loved that about her.  She was the first creature ever to see beyond his half-demon curse.",
        "Andre ran hard for a creature that was already dead.  Katie chased him, terrified of looking back when the awful sounds seemed so close.  Only when the ground stopped trembling did Andre stop.",
        "You're a difficult creature to find.",
        "The Ully-demon launched towards him.  The tree snatched Toby and lifted him to safety, and Toby dangled far enough over Ully's head that the demon couldn't reach him.  As he watched, the Ully-demon transformed into its natural form, a creature of wings, talons, and teeth longer than Toby's fingers.",
        "She was a gorgeous creature in her early twenties with a figure that would make a monk sigh.",
        "He wasn't sure a creature that lived more than one life was lucky.",
        "You're a fool to mess with a creature like me, Guardian.",
        "As Darian suspected, the small creature was unwilling to reveal its true intentions.",
        "The creature he sought was lifting weights, and bristled as Darian appeared.",
        "Instead of waiting for the Other to attack again, Darian spun and plunged his knife into the creature's belly.",
        "The Other's words slowed, and the creature looked down at the protruding weapon.",
        "Without another word, the creature dropped.",
        "Another vamp was suspended in a tree, pinned by purple-white lightning arcing from the hand of a small creature she recognized as an Other.",
        "If you knew the one I plan on pushing you down—and I will manipulate the fate of a selfish creature like you—you'd be running out of here screaming.",
        "He was headed down his own path, that of the Grey God, a creature that never existed before him.",
        "He sensed every creature in the room—except maybe the poor messenger—had an agenda.",
        "He looked from the creature to Jenn and approached her.",
        "\"I thought you would come,\" the small creature before him said.",
        "Jonny was born a god-slayer, the only creature that could take the place of a Black God.",
        "The creature she least wanted to see stood before her, eyes glowing red.",
        "\"Are you gonna do something about the Other creeping up on us?\" she asked, catching sight of the small creature.",
        "Darian said and shook the small creature.",
        "He spun as the creature materialized on the other end of the attic.",
        "I went after the creature, captured it, and forced it into many hosts.",
        "She ignored the voice of the creature coiled restlessly within her.",
        "This is the creature that attacked one of ours?",
        "And yet, the creature is generous and lets me take as much of his magic as I need, enough to build our walls in a season's time and make them stronger than the walls of my enemies.",
        "The disturbing sensation of being in a room with an otherworldly creature faded as he followed her into the hallway.",
        "This seems too simple, and I cannot yet dismiss the caution my great-uncle - -and his son, my cousin - -took when discussing the creature.",
        "Even on the verge of her death, she would not let loose the creature within her.",
        "How had Memon come upon the creature?",
        "There were no lessons to be learned, except what the creature taught me.",
        "The creature was right.",
