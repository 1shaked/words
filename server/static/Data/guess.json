        "Why did I or … I guess, the past-Deidre bring you back?",
        "Guess I shouldn't be surprised.",
        "My first guess would be hers.",
        "\"I guess,\" she said grudgingly.",
        "Right. Let me guess.",
        "I guess it really doesn't matter.",
        "I guess if the operation fails, I'll die anyway, right?",
        "I mean, I guess there could be two Gabriels in the Immortal world, she said.",
        "Luck of the draw, I guess.",
        "\"Or…women, I guess,\" Gabriel clarified.",
        "Let me guess, you have a headache.",
        "\"I guess,\" he said with a shrug.",
        "That sucks, I guess.",
        "\"Let me guess, you work for a dead doctor,\" she said, crossing her arms.",
        "I guess you wouldn't if you didn't plan on leaving Hell.",
        "My guess is Sasha snatched you.",
        "\"Guess that means I'll have to stop sleeping around,\" she retorted.",
        "\"I guess it's cheating when you can see the future,\" she mused.",
        "I guess you no longer interest me, since you.re just another of my slaves.",
        "I guess it really is Thanksgiving next week.",
        "I guess when you stop counting hours and days and just count months or years—",
        "What he considered me, I won.t even try to guess, but no, I didn.t.",
        "\"I can guess what this is about,\" Kiki said.",
        "I guess it wouldn.t matter if you succeeded in altering it like Kris said.",
        "\"Sorry. I guess I can see him doing that,\" she explained.",
        "\"I guess there comes a time where even the best of us are tempted,\" he reasoned.",
        "I guess they changed their mind.",
        "Let me guess, Darkyn, the Dark One ordered this.",
        "I guess I could visit for a week, if it means so much to you.",
        "I guess you got my message.",
        "Yeah. The usual, I guess.",
        "\"I guess he's not a war prisoner in the traditional sense,\" Evelyn replied.",
        "I guess the other guy just got caught this time.",
        "\"I guess that means …\" … you'll never let me go home.",
        "A'Ran didn't have to guess which her his uncle spoke of.",
        "\"I guess not,\" Evelyn said at her silence.",
        "I guess they told A'Ran you were killed, not taken.",
        "I guess I shouldn't be snoopy either, but we've had a lot of guests in the last six months and I've never felt this uncomfortable about any of the others.",
        "I guess I'm just frisky because it's so quiet around here.",
        "\"I'd guess so,\" Fred answered.",
        "I guess that's a fib.",
        "\"I guess so,\" he answered, surprised at the question.",
        "Wishful thinking, I guess.",
        "I'd guess she was real content here in Ouray.",
        "My guess is she sets the damn alarm multiple times every night.",
        "Just curious, I guess.",
        "Well, I guess it's time we see if Fred needs any help with our guests from Boston.",
        "I guess there's another skier for tomorrow's outing.",
        "And, I guess this guy Shipton is abusive, and doesn't take rejection very well.",
        "He treats Edith like a piece of the furniture—bangs her around too, I guess.",
        "I guess I just automatically think the worst of anything that comes out of Shipton's mouth, regardless.",
        "Before we can read what she wrote, we can only guess the reason for it.",
        "\"I guess the sisters spent the day at the museum,\" Cynthia said.",
        "I guess I'm busted, huh?",
        "I guess that doesn't show me as a sensitive and loving husband, huh?",
        "I guess that one slipped my mind.",
        "Oh, I guess I'm just being foolish like Claire says.",
        "I guess your gear is back in your car.",
        "My guess is love has nothing to do with it.",
        "I guess after reading this here notebook, it was a fool's errand.",
        "No, I guess I'm not.",
        "But I guess there's no reason to volunteer the information to her.",
        "I still do, I guess.",
        "It could have been anything, but I'd guess she had a serious rift at home, probably with her parents.",
        "My guess is she fled from some type of sexual encounter.",
        "I'd guess she left home quite young, perhaps as a mid-teenager, with little or no dough.",
        "It's none of my business what—\" \"I guess I deserved that.",
        "Vanoli's Gold Belt Theater was the place that got the most attention, but he owned The Roma that Annie mentions, plus saloons up in Red Mountain and I guess other places.",
        "Well, I guess it wasn't all pleasure, but still—it must have been electrifying!",
        "I guess I'm just blowing off steam.",
        "Stomping on everyone in his way, I guess.",
        "Then Whitehouse added begrudgingly, And I guess he's smart.",
        "But I guess that wasn't the first time.",
        "He was climbing alone, something I guess you're not supposed to do, especially if you're a beginner like Shipton was.",
        "And since it's snowed a foot or two since then, I'd guess there aren't any footprints to prove you were strolling alone in the woods.",
        "That would be my guess.",
        "I guess they'll keep her overnight.",
        "Nope. I'm surprised he wasn't, as far as he fell and I guess he is by now.",
        "My guess is Shipton either said something to someone before he croaked or he's still alive and talking.",
        "My guess is someone did a bit of planning for Jerome Shipton's big fall, and Edith hasn't demonstrated any real talent for long-range thinking.",
        "I guess she was afraid the police might search their stuff.",
        "This I am sure will occur if he is to guess my condition, which grows more noticeable as my time draws closer.",
        "My guess is any place Edith ain't is where you'll find Ryland for a while.",
        "But my guess is you don't have any reason to doubt Ryland loves you.",
        "It's okay, I guess.",
        "He wanted her to do something but then he went out and got killed, I guess.",
        "Kind of strange, I guess.",
        "I guess he wasn't the ideal patient so the doctors weren't inclined to put up much of a fuss.",
        "Long before she came to Ouray, I guess.",
        "I guess that's why she identified so much with Annie.",
        "I guess in a way I bonded with Donnie, thinking he did what I wanted to do.",
        "Everything piled up, I guess.",
        "I'd guess he learned from the notebook, after she was dead.",
        "I'd guess he cared for her, in his own way.",
        "I guess there was death—but not scary death—only inevitable, the-time-has-come kind of passing.",
        "\"Guess you won me,\" Martha said as she dropped a duffle bag on the hall floor.",
        "He's too busy making money, I guess.",
        "I guess I considered it as a possibility.",
        "And guess what else?",
        "Yup. He had a car, a rental I guess.",
        "No guess where he and the woman are staying?",
        "Do you want another guess?",
        "I'd guess Shipton left it.",
        "My guess is Edith left lots of little subtle clues around her house, letting hubby know where she was going.",
        "My guess is she acted out of some inner desperation.",
        "My guess is Donnie's muteness may be far more complicated.",
        "This is part guess, part fact, with both parts complicated.",
        "My guess is the missing piece of line fell into the river.",
        "\"I guess you could say that,\" Dean answered.",
        "I'm not quite sure what to do with that information, but thanks, I guess.",
        "When Sarah asked why, he answered, \"I don't know, I guess I'm running out of things to say.\"",
        "Well, I guess we're finished here.",
        "Oh, I guess I am a little sleepy.",
        "Well, I guess, but I hope you will at least try for a while.",
        "Well, you guess correctly, and for you those are nasty, for me, not so much.",
        "Um, yeah okay, I guess.",
        "Guess we should start stock piling bottles.",
        "Oh, I guess he thinks she'll be more comfortable in it.",
        "Hi, guess I was somewhere else.",
        "I guess you didn't get your omelet.",
        "He laughed and thought, Guess I could've brought the red Testarossa.",
        "Okay, I guess, it's still pretty weird though.",
        "Guess I'm the ugly duckling in this group.",
        "I guess my biggest reason is I don't want to lose her and let's face it, when I'm toothless and bald and she is still as beautiful as today, she's not going to want me.",
        "Just a little overwhelmed I guess.",
        "I guess I owe you an explanation.",
        "I tried to guess the pieces you liked, I'm anxious to see if I chose correctly.",
        "I'm sorry, guess I'm just a little tired.",
        "I guess I owe them a lot more than bread then.",
        "Well judging from your art collection and furnishings at Fairhaven I would guess you're about a hundred and fifty years old.",
        "I guess we can shelve that one for a while.",
        "I don't know, guess I never took an interest.",
        "Huh, I guess I hadn't thought about that.",
        "I guess I'll just have to quit school then.",
        "I guess I'll have to bring some sheet music for you then.",
        "I guess we should take them to your studio.",
        "I guess we'll have to kill some time while you clear out.",
        "He chuckled, \"Given your understanding at breakfast yesterday, I guess I am going to have to accept that.\"",
        "My best guess is that you two are soul-mates, destined to be together, and you have a higher purpose.",
        "I guess that plan didn't work.",
        "Oh my, I guess I was pretty tired.",
        "I guess I'm over-thinking things.",
        "I guess I could say it's a medical problem.",
        "I guess I am my own worst enemy.",
        "I guess this is going to take some getting used to.",
        "Well, I guess that makes it easy for us.",
        "I guess the Sidwell women can't resist the Parrish charm.",
        "I guess we're just a couple of insomniacs, huh?",
        "\"Hmm, I guess you're right,\" mused Jackson.",
        "Well… guess that explains why you're sore.",
        "I guess everybody knows what happened last night, but me.",
        "Sarah gasped, \"Wow, I guess that will be the last time you try to stay away, huh?\"",
        "In a week or so, I guess.",
        "I guess so, but I wonder sometimes if heredity is the major factor.",
        "I guess it must have snowed since you came out here.",
        "I guess the feed bill is considerably smaller, too.",
        "Then I guess I'll clean my room.",
        "I guess I must have fallen asleep.",
        "I guess I must be better.",
        "I guess I just like surprises.",
        "Kind of silly, when you get to thinking about it, I guess.",
        "I guess I was out of line, but...",
        "\"Then I guess she married the right man,\" he commented casually.",
        "\"Yeah. Well, I guess we can cross that bridge when we come to it,\" he answered curtly.",
        "I thought maybe yesterday... but I guess he had a lot on his mind.",
        "I guess he thinks I'm going to ransack his wallet or something.",
        "I guess men have always got to push women as far as they'll go.",
        "I guess that would make Penny Tessa's kid.",
        "I guess I'm scared, but I'm too tired to tell, she answered.",
        "I guess my grandfather was at one time a friend of Mr. Tim's.",
        "I guess she wouldn't play this morning at all but changed her mind this afternoon.",
        "He could guess her thoughts without hearing them: she was silently clucking at the army-type who thought he could boss around a fed.",
        "I guess this will work out after all.",
        "I guess she tried to escape and didn't get far.",
        "\"I guess the receivers don't matter too much now,\" she said.",
        "\"At first, I think it was knowing he was a black sheep like me.  My sister always treated me like I was a blight on the family name.  She tried to help me in her own way, I guess, which was better than what Rhyn's brothers did to him.  I wanted to believe he could make it in the Immortal world, because if he could, I could, too,\" she started.",
        "\"After I left the Sanctuary, I guess you could say I had a visitor who told me about Lilith and why you killed her.  How she was working with the Dark One to try to drag Kris and the rest of us down to Hell,\" Kiki explained.",
        "Though I guess if Death doesn't find their soul like she can't find yours, they can just … linger.",
        "The real Gabriel had been the one to tell her that the child she carried was a girl.   \"I guess we have to wait and see,\" she forced herself to say and added silently, I hope you're safe, Gabriel, wherever you are."
