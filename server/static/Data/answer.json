        "To answer your question, yes, he was supposed to be up on the mountain.",
        "The ding-dong prompted the pair to look across the bed to shame the other into a bathrobe to answer the door.",
        "When the phone finally rang, Dean jumped to answer.",
        "This time there was no doubt that Lydia laughed but didn't answer.",
        "\"Is Fitzgerald in there?\" he asked, not sure he wanted to know the answer.",
        "Lydia Larkin considered her answer.",
        "Dean wasn't sure how to answer.",
        "Before Martha could answer, the front door opened to Paul and Paulette Dawkins.",
        "He telephoned but there was no answer.",
        "She seemed to consider whether or not to answer.",
        "She wouldn't answer directly.",
        "When Dean didn't answer, she started the Chevy Blazer and turned it back toward town.",
        "The answer was almost a sob.",
        "\"No,\" came the answer, muted by a sob.",
        "He didn't answer to her anymore, as he had for thousands of years.",
        "Will you answer a question for me, Gabriel?",
        "Before you ask: the answer is no.",
        "When she didn't answer, Deidre faced her.",
        "I guess a better answer is that I need time to heal before I can trust myself to love you, Deidre.",
        "\"Who?\" he asked, unwilling to tell her that he already knew the answer to this question.",
        "He wasn't expecting anyone but Andre to answer.",
        "Several times the telephone rang and he hurried to answer it as if he were expecting a call.",
        "It was strange to have him turning to her for an answer on something.",
        "I know it's a bad time, but could I get you to answer a few questions?",
        "The answer came with her next thought.",
        "Alex had the answer to a question that was important to him.",
        "He deserved an honest answer about her response.",
        "That was his 'final answer' look which dictated there should be no more discussion.",
        "At least her answer wasn't no, and she had been thinking about it – researching.",
        "\"You know the answer,\" Wynn said.",
        "I may answer it.",
        "Gabriel was too busy to answer.",
        "She deserved it after last night, but still, why didn't he at least answer and tell her he was done with her?",
        "\"When your master asks, you answer,\" he snarled.",
        "The answer was mix of advanced medicine and magic.",
        "When you know the answer, come here.",
        "She didn't need him to answer.",
        "If you're here to ask where Deidre is, the answer is no.",
        "The answer you seek: Darkyn.",
        "He was silent, uncertain how to answer.",
        "He didn't answer her plea to reassure her some part of him cared for her.",
        "\"Does nothing bother you?\" he asked without heat, knowing the answer.",
        "\"Yeah, sure,\" came the less certain answer.",
        "\"Hey sis,\" she said after pressing the answer button.",
        "Whatever it is you want, the answer is no.",
        "His honest answer silenced her.",
        "She didn't answer, concentrating on figuring out where the hell she was.",
        "You never did answer my question about Andre.",
        "He didn't answer but crossed to a window and flipped on a light.",
        "The answer's not for me.",
        "She thought he'd refuse to answer until he said slowly,",
        "Then you better answer this question right.",
        "In four hundred thousand years, he hadn't learned to answer a phone right?",
        "\"And you.re no closer at all?\" she asked, holding her breath for the answer.",
        "Where is she? she asked, bracing herself for the answer.",
        "A tap at the door made Lankha pause, and she hurried to answer it to keep the healer from being distracted.",
        "The smallest of smiles crossed Kris.s face, but he refused to answer.",
        "The answer became clear.",
        "He pulled loose from her to answer it, not surprised to see another of the convent members there, probably to tell him the same thing the first did.",
        "Go find your master and come back when you have an answer.",
        "Before Evelyn could answer, another thought occurred to Kiera.",
        "I don't have an easy answer to your problem, if that's what you want.",
        "She knew what the answer was, but hadn't spoken it.",
        "She'd never given him an answer about staying with him on Anshan.",
        "Or would the fact that she never gave him an answer to stay or go make him unwilling to give her a second chance?",
        "If you keep buying 'opportunities' like Mr. Stanislaw's Salvation Army box, you'll be too broke to answer the door if a real opportunity does come knocking.",
        "But before Fred could answer, Cynthia patted him on the shoulder.",
        "Dean paused half way through his pie, awaiting Fred's answer.",
        "Dean didn't answer quick enough before Fred began eating his pie.",
        "The boy looked at his mother for an answer.",
        "She bit her lip but didn't answer, causing an uncomfortable silence.",
        "As he rose to answer it, he couldn't help noticing Edith Shipton's alarmed reaction to the ring.",
        "Neither Fred nor Cynthia had a ready answer.",
        "\"If it is some form of code, it must have been the devil to write,\" Dean said but before his wife could answer, there was a noise on the stairs.",
        "The answer seemed to please Edith Shipton and she appeared to relax.",
        "The woman didn't answer for a moment of unsettling silence.",
        "Edith closed her eyes as tears seeped down her cheeks but she wouldn't answer.",
        "Edith began to cry, but once again wouldn't answer.",
        "Dean took a deep breath and tried to consider the implications of his answer to the caller as he made his way to his bedroom.",
        "\"We're not going to get involved in another mess again, are we?\" he asked, knowing full well the answer.",
        "Donnie smiled and looked to Dean for an answer.",
        "He wasn't sure it was an entirely truthful answer.",
        "Before he could answer, Edith replied, sheepishly.",
        "\"I think we've had a day of it,\" was all Fred would answer.",
        "Edith just withdrew and wouldn't even answer him.",
        "Would you buy the answer that I ran into an incredible sale I couldn't pass up?",
        "How did you answer her?",
        "I learned a long time ago, that anyone who asks that question can't understand my answer anyway.",
        "He turned and walked off before waiting for an answer.",
        "Dean agreed and telephoned Janet O'Brien from the hall but there was no answer.",
        "I know we'll probably never learn the answer, but I still can't fathom what could have happened back in Boston to make Annie Quincy desert a comfortable life.",
        "She pulled away and growled her answer.",
        "Dean was wondering about her answer, as the telephone rang.",
        "Edith hesitated, as if pondering her answer.",
        "But she wouldn't answer.",
        "I don't want to answer any questions.",
        "He prays for an answer and I cry for his pain.",
        "When Weller didn't answer, Dean finally said, I was looking for Cynthia.",
        "Weller rocked back and at first Dean didn't think he'd answer.",
        "He called her again as soon as he rose, but she had apparently left earlier as there was no answer.",
        "Before they could answer, she turned on her heels and stumbled back to her quarters, diagonally across the hall.",
        "Why should I pay a hundred bucks an hour for some guy to tell me not to answer questions I don't mind answering in the first place?",
        "Maybe we can all save some time if we skip the part where you ask the questions and I just go ahead and answer them.",
        "The logical answer is a child—Donnie or Martha, picking it up out of curiosity.",
        "Before Dean could answer, there was an almost inaudible knock at the door.",
        "He crossed his fingers that he was ahead of the police, and his wife would be there to answer.",
        "Don't answer the phone when it rings.",
        "The third time, answer it—it'll be me.",
        "If you ain't here, Corday and the police can't ask you questions you might not want to answer, like what's Cynthia's Indiana address.",
        "She won't answer, but just in case the law's got a tap on the line it'll keep 'em off base.",
        "Dean scratched his head, but didn't answer.",
        "The obvious answer was to protect that person.",
        "Before Dean could answer, there was a knock on the front door and he rose to answer it.",
        "He knew full well the answer.",
        "No golden ring of an answer.",
        "I know you're upset, but this doesn't answer anything.",
        "Before he could answer, the bedside telephone shrilled, its shocking ring penetrating the late night stillness.",
        "When Cynthia didn't answer, he added, \"I miss you.\"",
        "He answered by instinct, yet, in spite of not thinking of his answer, had he been given more time to consider, it would have remained the same.",
        "That doesn't answer why Shipton said my name to you.",
        "Dean didn't respond but in his mind agreed the answer made a certain amount of sense, giving the situation.",
        "You weren't her answer.",
        "Weller looked as if the answer should have been obvious.",
        "There are a lot of questions about Edith Shipton I can't answer, but they don't make any difference.",
        "Fred seemed less than satisfied with Dean's answer but didn't push it.",
        "Dean didn't answer his stepfather.",
        "\"That's what the police believe,\" Dean answered, surprising himself with so qualified an answer.",
        "He could picture her sitting there, listening to the ringing telephone, but not wanting to answer it.",
        "They both knew the other obvious answer.",
        "Dean didn't answer but remembered Edith insisting it wasn't Dean who'd cut her husband's line.",
        "According to Weller, the answer is no.",
        "The phone continued to ring while Janet contemplated an answer.",
        "Dean wanted Fred to answer the damned thing but the old man was too nosy to move.",
        "She made a choking, gagging motion at her throat in answer to Donnie's written question.",
        "He didn't, however, give a quick, stock answer to the possibility.",
        "\"I can answer my own question,\" Cynthia said quietly.",
        "We can wonder what happened to the pen and who raided her panties but we'll probably never know the answer to either question.",
        "But it doesn't answer his injuries, does it?",
        "I will answer your questions and give you the information you need to get through this, but if you dare say one more disparaging word about my best friend, this will not end well for you.",
        "He lifted up a bit to see her feet and found the answer.",
        "We won't take no for an answer, will we Connor?",
        "Because I knew what your answer would be.",
        "I have no control over what I do during the full moon, and after, have no memory of my time as a wolf, so I can't answer that.",
        "She finished with a question and answer period and there were quite a few queries that seemed to impress her.",
        "He winked in answer.",
        "It was time to give Josh some kind of answer.",
        "\"I'm all right,\" she heard herself answer weakly.",
        "Her answer came swift and certain.",
        "His neck was red and for the first time since she had met him, he didn't have a quick answer.",
        "But you didn't answer my question.",
        "She woke and prayed fervently for an answer, and then fell asleep again - to the same nightmare.",
        "Brady waited, unusually interested in her answer.",
        "He expected her to name off Tim and answer his unasked question about the relationship between the two of them.",
        "He didn't realize how much he relied upon Angel's soothing voice until he heard her answer.",
        "Lana clenched her hands but didn't answer.",
        "He burned to know the answers to Elise's questions, not even able to fathom what the answer could be.",
        "She didn't answer but returned to the couch, perching on the edge.",
        "His teeth were grinding loudly enough for her to hear, and his face was ashen and drawn in a look of pain.  He couldn't answer – that much she discerned at the rippling muscles of his clenched jaw.",
        "Katie didn't answer for a moment, pensive.  Gabe glanced back at her then slowed, as if sensing she was growing tired.",
        "\"Yes,\" came the hushed answer.",
        "Answer the question, Rhyn.",
        "Kiki didn't have a chance to answer before the wooden door to their prison creaked open.  Rhyn's head spun as he was hauled up and dragged into a well-lit hallway.  Light and shadows wreaked havoc on his sense of place and time until he hit the cool stone floor again.",
        "Rhyn considered how he might use the demon, as he had once before.  He didn't answer, pushing the door open to the cell block.  Nearly all the cells were empty.  \"Where is everyone?\" he asked.",
        "If Toby can't find that answer, it's not something any of the angels know.  Or he's too young to tap into it fully.",
        "Answer me, Kris.  What is your deepest desire?",
        "Kris didn't answer, not wanting to think of how that conversation would go with the deity.  He tested his power again.  Kiki was right; they had none.",
        "Toby didn't answer, unwilling to admit just how much Ully's words stung.  He led them deeper into the jungle.  The branches hurried to create a path for him, and he smiled at them.  According to his angel memories, the trees were more than trees in Death's underworld.  They were alive.",
        "She rang the doorbell and we waited for someone to answer.",
        "When Byrne failed to answer a wake-up call the following morning, a clerk finally opened his room.",
        "Why would he skip, answer me that?",
        "\"My heart's in my mouth ever time it rings,\" she said and added an apology as she moved to answer it, just as Cynthia Byrne entered the room.",
        "Mrs. Riley set down the phone and moved to the door to answer it.",
        "Mayer's telephone rang and he excused himself to answer it, leaving Dean at Jeffrey Byrne's grey steel desk.",
        "Before Dean could answer, Mayer returned and Rudman beat a hasty retreat to his cubby hole.",
        "Marian, it's too early for a definitive answer, but don't give away your old golf outfit just yet.",
        "But hurry up with an answer.",
        "He returned to his rocker, sipped his beer and began to patiently answer the barrage of Fred's questions about his day's activities.",
        "He ticked off the items he had learned about Jeffrey Byrne during the course of the day, as much for his own review as to answer Fred's rapid-fire questions.",
        "Fred's answer came just as the music switched to a shrill voice pleading for her lover to come back to the hills.",
        "They alternated discussing what was hap­pening in their lives while the other nodded, injecting a polite one word answer occasionally, just to properly pretend interest.",
        "But to answer your question, I'm serious—it depends on where it hap­pened.",
        "That would answer a lot of questions.",
        "Dean slowly unwound himself from behind the steering wheel and crossed to answer it.",
        "Dean didn't answer, but held out his wallet to show his ID.",
        "This guy's got the answer to every little kid's what-would-you-do-if­you-had-a-million-bucks question.",
        "They climbed the stairs but there was no sign of life and no answer to knocks.",
        "She took her time considering her answer.",
        "\"Police business,\" Fred said before Dean could answer.",
        "Dean had no ready answer.",
        "He could answer that one without any effort—he hadn't decided.",
        "Dean didn't answer.",
        "He wasn't sure how to answer.",
        "The answer had frightening implications with Fred O'Connor at home alone.",
        "There was no answer at Collingswood Avenue—not a good sign.",
        "\"That doesn't answer how Nota knew about me,\" Dean said.",
        "Answer the man's question.",
        "\"Scranton's the answer,\" Fred said, ignoring Dean.",
        "No, no, don't answer that either.",
        "The answer is yes.",
        "Dean started to answer but Randy continued.",
        "At first he wouldn't answer the door but I could hear his wife bawling so I kept knock­ing 'til he came.",
        "Cece Baldwin didn't answer yet another call made from a corner payphone.",
        "Dean surprised himself with the firmness of his answer.",
        "While he knew he should report his suspicion of being bugged, he feared having to answer questions about his clandestine work in the Byrne matter.",
        "The phone rang twice and Randy tripped as he dashed across the room to answer.",
        "Once again, she didn't answer directly but described a well-known seafood restaurant on the New Jersey shore, at least two hours from Parkside.",
        "He bent his head back on the seat and closed his eyes but he didn't answer.",
        "He didn't answer and silence dragged on.",
        "She asked point-blank if I thought her husband was alive and I wouldn't answer.",
        "He took his time strolling down row after row of tents, paus­ing briefly to answer a young man's question about directions.",
        "She was in before he could answer.",
        "\"Shit!\" said Dean but when Fred didn't answer, he mumbled an introduction.",
        "\"I'll live,\" Dean said in answer to the anxious questions of the approaching group as he tried to catch his breath.",
        "Dean didn't answer but they both knew he agreed.",
        "Dean didn't stop to answer as he broke into a jog with Fred hustling to keep up.",
        "Josh was watching her, waiting for an answer."
