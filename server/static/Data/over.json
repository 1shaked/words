        "Yet he was arrested last week for selling drugs to kids like little Nicholas over there?",
        "Of course, the little red truck Dad had been drooling over.",
        "That was the last thing she remembered until she opened her eyes again and found all three of them hanging over her.",
        "She jumped up, pushing them all away, darting for the bathroom with a hand over her mouth.",
        "Fingers caressed her hand gently and then slipped over her palm.",
        "Howard leaned over her.",
        "\"I've got her purse over here,\" Connie said, holding up a shiny red purse.",
        "And yet the numbness hung over her like a thick fog.",
        "I'll go, but this isn't over.",
        "She desperately fought the steering wheel for control, but the car weaved all over the road.",
        "Over the dusty hood, the yawning valley beckoned, and then... the sound of metal grinding against rock.",
        "For a few moments the car hung there, the back half solidly on the ground, the front hanging precariously over the cliff.",
        "Paralyzed with fear, Lisa waited, expecting the car to slide over the edge.",
        "At any time a gust of wind could send the car over the cliff.",
        "Snaking her upper torso over the back of the seat, she began to shift her weight toward the back of the car.",
        "That ridge was the only thing that had kept her from plunging over the edge... that and the man who was now glaring at her.",
        "Dark bushy brows drew together over flashing blue eyes.",
        "Realization washed over her in alternating waves of pain and numbness.",
        "It just started rocking and then went over the edge.",
        "His nod was noncommittal as he examined the place where the car had gone over.",
        "She peered cautiously over the edge, but couldn't see the car.",
        "I'll take her over in the morning to get her stuff out of the car.",
        "Oh my, you're fortunate the car didn't go over the edge with you in it!",
        "Her hand hung over the phone a minute as she fought with the urge to call Howard.",
        "Using her momentum, he swung her over his head.",
        "Tammy half skipped and hopped down the hall, throwing a shy smile over her shoulder at Lisa before disappearing into a doorway.",
        "Giddon glanced at her sharply over the top of the paper.",
        "When she didn't respond, he peered over the paper again.",
        "A four wheel ATV was parked next to the porch and Giddon stepped over it, seating himself as he turned the key.",
        "\"You'll have to hold on to me,\" he spoke gruffly over a shoulder.",
        "The ATV climbed over large rocks, threatening to unseat them both at any moment.",
        "Lisa giggled and he glanced over his shoulder at her.",
        "He looked it over and commented on the sturdy quality and length.",
        "He threw her a sharp look over his shoulder.",
        "At one point he splashed through a mud puddle, throwing mud and water all over her.",
        "Fine, let's get this over with.",
        "I'll be over there in a few minutes so you can show me what needs to be taken care of while you're gone.",
        "It was a hot afternoon, and she had thrown a light cotton sundress over her swimsuit.",
        "His arms were folded across his chest, one leg thrown carelessly over the other.",
        "Diablo trotted over to welcome his master, nuzzling and nickering.",
        "He dropped the saddle to the ground and slipped a halter over the horses' nose.",
        "Diablo stood hip-shod, his eyes half-closed as Giddon tossed a saddle blanket over his back and then swung up the saddle.",
        "He leaned over to unlatch the gate and then rode through, heading down the drive toward the road.",
        "Allen swaggered over to the pool, a conceited smile on his handsome face.",
        "His bloodshot gaze wandered over her figure in a way that made her regret leaving her beach robe in the house.",
        "He towered over them both, the muscles in his arms and shoulders straining against his shirt as he hooked his thumbs in the front pockets of his jeans.",
        "A wisp of blond hair hung over one eye and Lisa brushed it back.",
        "He slung the dishtowel over his shoulder and one long step brought him to a point where she was pinned in the corner of the counter.",
        "She searched around for a landmark that could be seen over the trees, but nothing was tall enough.",
        "She lit with one foot underneath her body, and the momentum of her fall threw her forward - over the ledge.",
        "One second she was falling head over heels, the next rolling on her side.",
        "She put the offending foot on the ground, tentatively applying a little weight, clamping a hand over her mouth to stop the cry of pain.",
        "Yet, one backward glance at the hard lines of the face over hers reminded her that there was more than the gentle side to him.",
        "You think things over for a long time before you make decisions – even in small matters.",
        "That's it over there.",
        "He started walking over to the car.",
        "She looked over the car and expressed her approval, but her mind was consumed with guilt.",
        "As she brushed by him on her way to her room to dress, she asked over her shoulder.",
        "She brushed the hair back over her shoulders.",
        "She pulled over beside the road and dialed his number.",
        "It rang several times and then switched over for her to leave a message.",
        "Lisa watched as he parked his car and walked over to examine hers.",
        "\"When we first came here,\" he began in a quiet voice, \"I used to walk all over these hills.\"",
        "Instantly the hand dropped and he turned back down the trail, speaking over his shoulder.",
        "You'll get ticks and chiggers all over you.",
        "Maybe he had more information he didn't want to give over the phone with Yancey listening.",
        "Pulling a robe over her nightgown, she tiptoed down the hall and silently opened the door to the patio.",
        "Yancey expertly caught the head of the serpent between the forks of a stick and bent over to pick it up.",
        "I've been sitting right over there.",
        "\"Sit down and I'll pour some coffee,\" she said over her shoulder.",
        "Lisa rolled over, coughing and gagging, unable to get enough breath at a time to fill her lungs.",
        "Connie said you were coming over to get the bills this evening.",
        "Here, why don't you sit down on this chair while I look you over and ask a few questions.",
        "Now that it was over, she was falling apart.",
        "And yet, it had been her goal for over three years.",
        "Yancey's face was over hers.",
        "She clamped a hand over her mouth and gasped in horror.",
        "She tiptoed over to one of the cloth-covered objects, keeping a wary eye on the door, and carefully lifted the cloth.",
        "A 55-gallon barrel stood in one corner with rags hanging over the edge.",
        "She was opening her mouth to respond when Yancey pulled over and stopped.",
        "Lisa clamped a hand over her mouth, her eyes burning with tears.",
        "I don't know what came over me to act that way.",
        "His pictures are all over the house.",
        "And you looked me over defiantly.",
        "Brandon stood, his tall form unfolding like an accordion until he towered over her again.",
        "Thick brown brows crouched over darkening eyes.",
        "Let's get over to the Git 'N' Go and back.",
        "Being the only child, she was probably over protective of him.",
        "She was the middle of two sisters, but Mom fussed over their baby brother.",
        "Of course, Brandon was a little old for mama to be fussing over him.",
        "What had come over him, anyway?",
        "After a few minutes, he reached over to change it.",
        "Maybe they had time to get over the shock.",
        "Now get over here and I'll give you a hand up.",
        "They were all giggling over coffee when Brandon walked in.",
        "We were looking all over the place for you.",
        "Brandon stepped over to the stove and poured a cup of coffee.",
        "Mrs. Marsh sat in a chair opposite Adrienne, hunched over like an old woman.",
        "It would start all over again.",
        "Time to be with his mother, and time to get over his father's death.",
        "He dropped the shirt and stepped over to her.",
        "She'd get over him.",
        "Getting over Brandon wasn't near as easy as getting her cap and stripes.",
        "Over the next few days she thought about the job several times with mixed feelings.",
        "She might be getting over him, but the idea of running into him in town was particularly disturbing.",
        "She reached out and put her hand over the ring, stopping its infernal winking.",
        "With a final glance at the approaching figures, she dropped from the wagon seat and sauntered over to join the men at the cook fire.",
        "A woman your age ought to be looking for a husband – or already married, not chasing all over creation in pants, trying to act like a man.",
        "Cassie sent him a measured look over her coffee cup before she spoke.",
        "When all the wagons were ready, she snapped the whip over the back of the mules.",
        "As the big wheels turned, they tossed sand up and over the rim.",
        "Pete threw his feet over the wagon seat and dropped to the ground.",
        "He scraped sand over the scorpion, burying it from her view.",
        "She quickly whipped up pancake dough and placed a large iron skillet over the fire with some lard in it.",
        "She handed Bordeaux a plate full of flapjacks she had been keeping warm by the fire and poured some honey over the top.",
        "She lifted her whip and expertly popped it over the back of the lead mule.",
        "If you throw one more dead animal at my feet, I'm going to beat you over the head with it.",
        "He folded his hands over the saddle horn and gazed down at her.",
        "The moon peeked shyly over the dunes and moved searching fingers of dim light across the dunes.",
        "Finding nothing, she spread the blanket and lay down, pulling part of it over her body.",
        "A wave of loneliness washed over her.",
        "Cassie kicked sand over the fire.",
        "Cassie rolled over and stood, dusting sand from her clothes.",
        "She dropped back on the blanket and yanked it over her body.",
        "She poured sand over the fire and waited long enough to make it appear she had given his invitation consideration.",
        "Davis watched with some apprehension, but Fritz and Royce were doubling over with laughter.",
        "The pace increased until a horse leaped over the wagon tongue and into the circle.",
        "He leaned over to get more coffee and Cassie pored him another cup.",
        "He mulled it over in silence, sipping on his coffee while they all waited for his decision.",
        "His eyes constantly roved over the dunes and his rifle lay across his lap, ready for use.",
        "Let's give the mules a rest while I look over our back trail.",
        "He dropped to the sand and crawled the rest of the way to the top, peering over the edge before he motioned for her to continue.",
        "She leaned across him, holding his hat over the glasses as he had shown her.",
        "He lowered the glasses and rolled over on his back, gazing up into her face.",
        "He pulled his hat over his eyes.",
        "Cassie scooped sand to make a pillow and put her hat over her face.",
        "She rolled over and glanced at Bordeaux, who seemed to be resting comfortably.",
        "Bordeaux paused beside Pete and spoke to him for a moment before he strolled over to join Cassie.",
        "He cupped his hand to her ear so she could hear over the howl of the rising wind.",
        "It took them over an hour to fill all the canteens.",
        "It'll be over before you know it.",
        "Bordeaux lay against her back, one arm around her waist and one leg thrown carelessly over hers.",
        "Is it necessary to have someone say words over us, when we already know what we want?",
        "Bordeaux clamped a hand over her mouth before she could speak.",
        "He removed his hand and they moved back against the rock wall of lava that swirled over them.",
        "Bordeaux cupped a hand over its muzzle, silencing the horse.",
        "Gradually, the women and children drifted over to examine her.",
        "She asked over her shoulder.",
        "She pulled the buffalo robe over her shoulders and stared at his form in the moonlight.",
        "Breakfast over, Bordeaux saddled his horse and pulled the field glasses from his saddlebag.",
        "We can talk over supper.",
        "The long ordeal in the desert was over, but what waited for her now was uncertain.",
        "She rolled over and wiped the tears from her cheeks.",
        "We had no control over what happened.",
        "She picked the flower up and poked it over her left ear.",
        "He glanced at the flower over her ear.",
        "He wrapped the reins around the break and stepped over to greet Darcie.",
        "The buggy bounced over a rock and she clutched his arm to keep from falling off.",
        "She threw her leg over the horse and dropped to the ground in a swirl of skirts.",
        "Finally he drew back and slid her over to the seat beside him.",
        "All that over with, he was solemn now.",
        "The conversation was over - or so she thought.",
        "On the positive side, at that rate their conversation should be over by five minutes after nine.",
        "I have over three thousand acres.",
        "It was hard to tell whether the sarcasm had gone over his head or he simply wasn't amused.",
        "Whatever. Just think it over and don't jump into something you might live to regret.",
        "That door over there is your personal bathroom.",
        "The alarm clock buzzed insistently and she reached over to slap the snooze button, squinting at the iridescent hands.",
        "Mr. Cade, do you mind if I have a friend over now and then?",
        "You may call or have friends over anytime you wish - as long as they don't interfere with your work.",
        "No point mulling over a decision she had already made.",
        "She leaned over and picked up a block of wood.",
        "I guess I'll have to put something over it.",
        "He looked so tall, standing over her that way.",
        "Cynthia leaned over as they drew near one and tried to pet it, but the cow moved away a few steps and began grazing again.",
        "Leaning into one stirrup, she forced her other leg over the back of the horse and dismounted.",
        "She tried to smile cheerfully as she looked at him over one shoulder.",
        "She breathed deeply of the clear air and listened to the sound of the creek darting over rocks - swirling against its banks.",
        "Like the way his broad shoulders swayed so gracefully with each step as he strode to the corral - or the way he lounged in a doorway, coffee in one hand, one long leg thrown carelessly over the other.",
        "Sometimes. Anyway, it's the paneling that makes the room so dark, not the curtains over the windows.",
        "For a minute she was afraid she had stepped over the line.",
        "We're not talking over a thousand dollars, are we?",
        "When she reminded him that he was going over the thousand-dollar figure he had thrown out, he merely shrugged.",
        "People had limited control over their emotions, but they could certainly remain in control of their actions.",
        "At Mary's startled look, she was afraid she had stepped over the line.",
        "Don't over do it.",
        "I meant don't over work yourself.",
        "It was time to pack up and get out - as soon as the visit from his sister was over.",
        "She made her way clumsily through one episode and then watched as his long fingers moved gracefully over the keys.",
        "Now that was a good example of her imagination working over time.",
        "She tossed her head to throw the curls from her face and rolled over in bed.",
        "The very next day she was straining over the counter to reach behind the stove when Cade came into the kitchen.",
        "A wave of warmth rushed up her neck and broke over her cheeks.",
        "She leaned over the sink, retching uncontrollably.",
        "Cool fingers brushed her cheek lightly and she woke to find Cade leaning over her.",
        "He leaned over and kissed her cheek lightly and then straightened.",
        "Over the next couple of weeks, Cynthia made a few visits to town, once taking in a movie before she returned.",
        "The storm moved over them as they ate, rumbling and flashing angrily.",
        "She threw the pillow over her head, drawing the light blanket up against her chin.",
        "And then he moved over her, his fingers sliding up her arm as it lay beside her head.",
        "A shadow fell over her and she turned into the sun, shading her eyes with a gloved hand.",
        "Cade was standing over her, a puzzled expression on his face as he contemplated her work.",
        "I'm going to move some of them over there.",
        "Over supper they talked of the expected foal, the ranch, and everything but why they hadn't talked much for the last four days.",
        "You're welcome here no matter what - just pack up and come over.",
        "You use this lever to lower the sickle, like this and then lift it over stumps and such.",
        "She ran her hand over the smooth clean surface of the baler.",
        "I was hoping I was simply a few weeks late, but it's been over three now and then this started.",
        "He lifted the apron over her head.",
        "I knew I'd have to talk to you about it sooner or later, but I didn't want to hold the financial burden of an unplanned pregnancy over your head like a club.",
        "He's thirty-six years old and starting life over; he's an empty box.",
        "\"You betcha, cousin,\" she replied as she leaned over the table and kissed him on the cheek.",
        "If you're concerned about a messed up head, either shave it all off or comb over the scars.",
        "I put my hand over her mouth.",
        "When the meal was over, I sought him out in the main room while the other crowded around the kitchen cleaning up.",
        "Quinn said from over my shoulder, startling me.",
        "After the testing is over, the hard part begins; weighing and recording my compilations and comparing them to past exposure levels.",
        "We discussed my non-happening over chicken salad and cheese soup.",
        "Quinn peeked over the edge of his magazine as Martha brought a pen and pad from the kitchen.",
        "Martha knocked over her chair as she rushed to the kitchen.",
        "He looked over to me.",
        "To tell the truth, I did it because I was pissed off at him over my losing Annie.",
        "Brockville is just over the border from Maryland and Washington.",
        "I'm stuck here over the weekend anyway... with nothing much to do.",
        "Let's talk about it over a drink.",
        "When it was over, he pulled a business card from his pocket that listed the location of his hotel.",
        "Over pie and coffee that followed a meat loaf dinner, Betsy asked the question on all our minds.",
        "I put my hands over my ears.",
        "Everyone was tired so after perfunctory greetings over a single glass of wine for those of us drinking, we retreated to our sleeping quarters.",
        "Quinn asked the question over oatmeal and raisin toast on Saturday morning.",
        "Over lunch he shared his thoughts.",
        "At Martha's suggestion over coffee the next morning we decided on the public library in nearby Lynn as our destination.",
        "Betsy and I were more shocked at the buried animosity that the other three must have witnessed over the past few weeks.",
        "As soon as the mother entered the house, he pocketed the phone, scaled the fence at a low corner, crossed to the surprised boy in a few steps, and placed a rag over his face.",
        "He grabbed the child under his arm and after dropping the now limp boy on the other side, climbed back over.",
        "I looked over her shoulder as she typed in pay phones.",
        "Our little group anguished over our decision once we were back together, alternating between chastising and applauding what we'd done.",
        "Don't over use it."
