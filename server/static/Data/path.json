Rhyn found a deer path and followed it until he reached a snowy meadow.  Crossing it, he continued to look for a place to stash the angel where the kid wouldn't freeze to death.  After another hour of walking, he found a small pocket in the roots of a massive tree.",
        "The forest was soon filled with the sound of pursuers.  Katie needed no further encouragement.  She pulled her arm free and ran behind Gabriel as he kept to the invisible path.  A shadow caught her attention.  She glanced over and froze, tripping.",

        "His shove almost drove her to her knees again.  She steadied herself and looked up in time to see him disappear into the jungle.  Fear made her heart pound.  The strange path he'd been following appeared ahead of her, revealing itself only a few steps at a time.  She started at a walk and quickened to a jog, making sure the path wouldn't close and trip her.  The path kept up with her, and she ran.",
        "Katie hesitated then continued onto the path Gabriel had told her to follow.  She didn't know what the creature was.  He looked like Andre, but Andre was dead-dead, which meant the creature following them was something else.",
        "Katie frowned.  In the course of a day, Gabe had gone from emotional to unaffected when discussing Death.  He was distracted, and she felt like she was talking to someone completely different.  Blaming herself for taking his mind off of their survival, she fell silent and followed him.   Briars and branches caught her pant legs, and she found herself slowing to push more and more of the jungle's flora out of the way.  Gabe, too, began to struggle with the bramble, and she noticed the jungle no longer laid their path before him.  Instead of clearing away to allow them passage, it stayed where it was, obstructing them.",
        "Gabe cast an irritated look over his shoulder but looked where she indicated.  He lowered the sword he was using to hack through the brush and started in that direction.  Katie watched as the forest cleared a path for him, the way it had before.",
        "I want my mate back, and I will destroy anyone in my path.",
        "Toby didn't answer, unwilling to admit just how much Ully's words stung.  He led them deeper into the jungle.  The branches hurried to create a path for him, and he smiled at them.  According to his angel memories, the trees were more than trees in Death's underworld.  They were alive.",
        "Katie started in the direction of the woman's voice.  She stumbled over fallen, slick wood and brambles she couldn't see.  Whatever magic that had cleared a path for her was gone.  She struggled through the jungle before calling out, \"Can you hear me?  I can't see much.  You'll have to say something, so I can find you.\"",
        "Katie angled herself towards the voice once again.  The woman was close.  She continued and then stopped suddenly, nearly tripping over the small form in her path.",
        "She pulled, and he ran.  Katie felt the ground shake beneath them as the demons pursued.  Several flew overhead and dropped directly in their path.  She stopped and shoved Toby behind her, drawing the knife Gabe had given her.  Before long, they were surrounded.",
        "\"Gabe!\" the angel cried.  Katie pressed back against the wall of the palace.  The demons gathered around them, and she saw the flash of Gabe's weapons as he tried to cut a path through the creatures towards them.  The death-dealer went down as three demons dog-piled him.",
        "His route to Philly looked like a drunkard's path, zigzagging a series of country roads that were at times crowded with local traffic.",
        "Dean half-felt his way across the parking lot in his bare feet, cursing the pebbles and splashing through ankle-deep puddles at curbside before stumbling into the absolute darkness of the beach-side path.",
        "He groped his way down the path, the wind whipping his raincoat behind him, until he felt the mush of soft sand beneath his aching feet.",
