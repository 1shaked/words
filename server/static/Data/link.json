        "A two-point segment of an end-to-end physical circuit. A circuit may consist of a single link, as would be the case between a host computer and a directly attached peripheral, such as a printer. A circuit commonly comprises multiple links. For example, a telephone set may connect across a link to a central office switch at the edge of the carrier network, that central office switch may connect to another central office switch across a link, and to yet another central office switch across a link, and finally to another telephone set across a link. In this scenario, two terminal devices connect via an end-to-end circuit that comprises four links interconnected by three central offices. Link sometimes is used interchangeably with line or circuit.",

In a cellular network, the uplink is the upstream radio link from the mobile station to the base station and the downlink is the downstream link from the base station to the mobile station.
