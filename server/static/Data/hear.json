        "They say ice climbing is a dangerous sport, so remember you all, be careful out there, you hear?",
        "I hear he had a boy who drowned.",
        "From what I hear, one ex-guest doesn't have any more welfare and the welfare of the rest of the group can wait until morning.",

        "If he was getting ready to make an indecent proposal, she didn't want Katie to hear the squelching reply she had planned.",
        "\"I never thought I'd hear you say that,\" she retorted dryly, and then realized she had nothing on but the thin hospital gown.",
        "Sure, but I want to hear it from your lips.",
        "That's what I've been waiting to hear.",
        "It was going to be nice to hear him every morning.",
        "She waited breathlessly, straining to hear the least noise.",
        "His name is Alex, and I don't want to hear you call him stud again.",
        "Pleased to hear from the Guardian, she found herself smiling.",
        "\"Didn't you ever hear your grandparents tell stories about how they met and got married?\" she pursued.",
        "Elise's news of the PMF fighting alongside her forces wasn't something Lana expected to hear.",
        "If I hear this nonsense again, I'll send you outside the walls to deal with this mess personally.",
        "Lana reached Arnie and spoke to him too quietly to hear.",
        "You hear about the Peak?",
        "I'm happy to hear she's okay.",
        "She wished to talk to Guardian again, to hear his take on the world.",
        "\"Hey, Elise,\" Dan said, tapping the button behind his hear to access his personal net.",
        "For all we know, the reports we hear are false and the whole country is like this.",
        "I'm sorry to hear that.",
        "Even hearing his voice, she couldn't help thinking she'd heard him because she wanted to hear his voice again, not because she actually had.",
        "Lana lay down, relieved to hear his voice again.",
        "This will all be worth it to hear you say you were wrong about something, and I was right.",
        "His teeth were grinding loudly enough for her to hear, and his face was ashen and drawn in a look of pain.  He couldn't answer – that much she discerned at the rippling muscles of his clenched jaw.",
        "Rhyn crept carefully through the demon scouts positioned throughout the forest surrounding the castle.  The demons wore the Dark One's uniform of all black with waterproof cloaks and hoods.  The demon side of him rendered his presence similar enough to a full-demon's that the others wouldn't be alarmed.  He sized up each demon he passed, until he found one who appeared to be his size.  The creature didn't hear his soft step, and the snapping of the demon's neck was the only other sound in the falling rain.",
        "\"That's what I hear,\" Ully said.",
        "Katie started in the direction of the woman's voice.  She stumbled over fallen, slick wood and brambles she couldn't see.  Whatever magic that had cleared a path for her was gone.  She struggled through the jungle before calling out, \"Can you hear me?  I can't see much.  You'll have to say something, so I can find you.\"",
        "Instinct and fury blinded him.  He felt the dagger sink into flesh and struck again, only to find himself flying backwards through the air.  Rhyn shouted something at him, but Kris couldn't hear him, not with the memory of both Lilith and Hannah dying.",
        "Rhyn stopped in place.  He'd never thought he'd hear her voice again, and he couldn't remember the last time he'd heard anything that stopped his world in place.  He turned to see Katie supporting Hannah as they entered the Sanctuary courtyard.  Katie wore simple jeans and a t-shirt.  Her dark curls cascaded down her shoulders, and her face glowed.  Her bright eyes locked on his.  She stopped too far away for his comfort, struggling to support her sister.",
        "You hear from her?",
        "I could hear footsteps and then the door swung open.",
        "Were you surprised to hear he'd gone swimming—out to the beach alone at midnight?",
        "Mrs. Wassermann wants to hear from someone first thing.",
        "I hear Jake's got a new employ­er in Philly.",

        "Whatever Vinnie was babbling about sounded like the last thing in the world Dean wanted to get involved with, but he had no choice but to at least hear out the terrified man.",
        "He considered taking Vinnie to jail for safekeep­ing, but the petrified man wouldn't hear of it.",
        "Unless I hear it from the other person.",
        "Don't condemn him before you hear the evidence.",
        "You all come back, you hear.",
        "You could hear everything.",
        "His room was on the far side—away from the bed, so we couldn't hear as well as the other.",
        "\"Nice to see you,\" Dean said, waiting to hear the real reason for Rudman's visit.",
        "\"Let's hear it again,\" said Winston with a sigh.",
        "I could hear it before I'd get to the front door.",
        "Besides, if an eighteen-wheeler was going to make \"possum pizza\" out of him, he wanted to hear it coming.",
        "Can't hear much with a towel over your head.",
        "Sorry to hear about your house being hassled.",
        "To tell the truth, I didn't think I'd ever hear from him.",
        "I want to hear from your mouth your being here has nothing to do with Vinnie Baratto.",
        "We didn't hear noth­ing and Phil got sick of waiting—he was next—so he went out and looked.",
        "At first he wouldn't answer the door but I could hear his wife bawling so I kept knock­ing 'til he came.",
        "Ethel yelled into the phone, loud enough for Tom DeLeo to hear at the next desk.",
        "\"Listen,\" said Dean, with a handkerchief in front of the mouthpiece, \"I hear you're looking for Jeffrey Byrne.\"",
        "When he reached her vehicle, he could hear her anguished sobs through the closed windows.",
        "It was the question Dean didn't want to hear.",
        "When I hear from him, I'll give him your phone num­ber.",
        "Dean could hear the smile in his voice, as if he was pleased.",
        "Dean could hear him jump up and he felt the left handcuff being unfastened and a key being pressed into his hand.",
        "Dean could hear Burgess feel­ing around the nightstand.",
        "But it was nice to hear it—the nicest words she'd ever spoken.",
        "He really relates to horses, and I hear his riding skills are very good.",
        "I hear he plans to get two of everything.",
        "Hopefully Alex would hear it and unplug his computer.",
        "When she didn't hear Darian drop behind her, she turned.",
        "She sidled up to him one last time, pausing close enough to hear him breathing.",
        "He's normal now, I hear.",
        "I never thought I'd hear you say something like that!",
        "\"I hear a Jenn-like lecture approaching,\" she said and crossed her arms as she faced him.",
        "If Alex had been where he could hear that for the second time tonight, it probably would have bothered him.",
        "I thought the creek was close, but I don't hear it.",
        "He nodded, apparently still waiting to hear the rest of the story.",
        "No doubt it wasn't what he wanted to hear and there was another uncomfortable silence.",
        "If it had not been for the fact that he was speaking so distinctly, she probably wouldn't have been able to hear the translation.",
        "It was impossible to hear what he was saying with so many people speaking."
