        "Metaphysically, he did not, indeed, as is often supposed, think the nature of substance to be matter and form, because in his view God is a substance, yet with no matter; but he did think that every natural substance or body is a concrete whole, composed of matter and form different from matter.",
        "He thought not only that a form, or essence, is something different from, and at most conjoined with, matter in a concrete body, but also that in all the bodies of one kind, e.g.",

        "CONCRETE, the name given to a building material consisting generally of a mixture of broken stone, sand and some kind of cement.",
        "A remarkable extension of the use of concrete has been made possible by the introduction of scientific methods of combining it with steel or iron.",
        "Piles made of steel concrete are driven into the ground with blows that would shatter the best of timber.",
        "A fuller description of the combination of steel and concrete will be given later.",
        "The constituents of concrete are sometimes spoken of as the matrix and the aggregate, and these terms, though somewhat oldfashioned, are convenient.",
        "The matrix is the lime or cement, whose chemical action with the added water causes the concrete to solidify; and the aggregate is the broken stone or hard material which is embedded in the matrix.",
        "It has been to a great extent superseded by Portland cement, on account of the much greater strength of the latter, though lime concrete is still used in many places for dry foundations and small structures.",
        "The hydrated lime, after being passed through a fine screen to sort out any lumps unaffected by the water, is ready for concrete making, and if not required at once should be stored in a dry place.",
        "They have the property of entering into chemical combination with the lime, forming a hard setting compound, and increasing the hardness of the resulting concrete.",
        "Experience shows that, although spherical pebbles are to be avoided, Portland cement adheres tightly to smooth flint surfaces, and that rough stones often give a less compact concrete than smooth ones on account of the difficulty of bedding them into the matrix when laying the concrete.",
        "In mixing concrete there is always a tendency for the stones to separate themselves from the sand and cement, and to form \"pockets\" of honeycombed concrete which are neither water-tight nor strong.",
        "For first-class work, however, and especially in steel concrete, it is customary to reject very large stones, and to insist that all shall pass through a ring a of an inch in diameter.",
        "The water, like all the other constituents of concrete, should be clean and free from vegetable matter.",
        "Sometimes in massive concrete structures large and heavy stones as big as a man can lift are buried in the concrete after it is laid in position but while it is still wet.",
        "Such concrete is known as rubble concrete.",
        "In proportioning the quantities of matrix to aggregate the ideal to be aimed at is to get a concrete in which the voids or air-spaces shall be as small as possible; and as the lime or cement is usually by far the most expensive item, it is desir able to use as little of it as is consistent with strength.",
        "If the situation is cool, the stone hard, and the concrete carefully rammed directly it is laid down and kept moist with damp cloths, only just sufficient to moisten the whole mass is required.",
        "On the other hand, water should be given generously in hot weather, also when absorbent stone is used or when the concrete is not rammed.",
        "In these cases the concrete should be allowed to take all it can, but an excess of water which would flow away, carrying the cement with it, should be avoided.",
        "The thorough mixing of the constituents is a most important item in the production of good concrete.",
        "Roughly it may be said that where a large mass of concrete is to be mixed at one or two places a good machine will be of great advantage.",
        "When mixed the concrete is carried at once to the position required, and if the matrix is quick-setting Portland cement this operation must not be delayed.",
        "One of the few drawbacks of concrete is that, unlike brickwork or masonry, it has nearly always to be deposited within moulds or framing which give it the required shape, and which are removed after it is set.",
        "It is essential that they shall be strong and stiff, so as not to yield at all from the pressure of the wet concrete.",
        "The shutters must be planed, and coated with a mixture of soap and oil, so as to come away easily after the concrete is set.",
        "Moreover, when depositing the concrete, a shovel or other tool must be worked between the wet concrete and the shutter.",
        "Sometimes rough concrete is rendered over with a plaster of cement and sand after the shutters have been removed, but this is liable to peel off and should be avoided.",
        "If for important walls, or for small scantlings such as steel concrete generally involves, the concrete should be deposited in quite small quantities and very carefully rammed ng osit- into position.",
        "Depositing concrete under water for breakwaters and bridge foundations requires special skill and special appliances.",
        "It is usually done in one of three ways: - (a) By moulding the concrete ashore into large blocks, which, when sufficiently hard, are lowered through the water into position by a crane or similar machine with the aid of divers.",
        "(b) By moulding the concrete into what are called \"bag-blocks.\"",
        "In this system the concrete is filled into bags, which are at once lowered through the water like the blocks.",
        "But in this case the concrete being still wet can adapt itself more or less to the shape of the adjoining bags, and strong rough walls can be built in this way.",
        "The canvas was laid in a hopper barge and there filled with the concrete and sewn up. The enormous bag was then dropped through a door in the bottom of the barge upon the breakwater foundation.",
        "(c) By depositing the wet concrete through the water between temporary upright timber frames which form the two faces of the wall.",
        "Indeed, this is bound to happen more or less, but it is guarded against by lowering the concrete slowly in a special box, the bottom of which is opened as it reaches the ground on which the concrete is to be laid.",
        "This method can only be carried out in still water, and where strong and tight framing can be built which will prevent the concrete from escaping.",
        "The concrete escapes from the bag, which is then drawn up and refilled.",
        "Concrete may be compared with other building materials like masonry or timber from various points of view, such as strength, durability, convenience of building, fire resistance, appearance and cost.",
        "for lime concrete, and 1 to 5 cwt.",
        "for Portland cement concrete.",
        "The safe tensile strength of Portland cement concrete would be something like one-tenth of its compressive strength, and might be far less.",
        "Hence slabs or beams of long span should not be built of plain concrete, though when reinforced with steel it is admirably adapted for these purposes.",
        "In regard to durability good Portland cement concrete is one of the most durable materials known.",
        "The same praise cannot, however, be given to lime concrete.",
        "Portland cement concrete, on the other hand, may be used without fear in sea-water, provided that certain reasonable precautions are taken.",
        "Considerable alarm was created about the year 1887 by the failure of two or three large structures of Portland cement concrete exposed to seawater, both in England and other countries.",
        "But to ensure the permanence of structures in sea-water the great object is to choose a cement containing as little lime and alumina as possible, and free from sulphates such as gypsum; and more important still to proportion the sand and stones in the concrete in such a way that the structure is practically non-porous.",
        "On the other hand, if the concrete is rough and porous the sea-water will gradually eat into the heart of the structure, especially in a case like a dam, where the water, being higher on one side than the other, constantly forces its way through the rough material, and decomposes the Portland cement it contains.",
        "As regards its convenience for building purposes it may be said roughly that in \"mass\" work concrete is vastly more convenient than any other material.",
        "But concrete is hampered by the fact that the surface always has to be formed by means of wooden or other framing, and in the case of thin walls or floors this framing becomes a serious item, involving expense and delay.",
        "In appearance concrete can rarely if ever rival stone or brickwork.",
        "It is true that it can be moulded to any desired shape, but mouldings in concrete generally give the appearance of being unsatisfactory imitations of stone.",
        "These defects will no doubt be overcome as concrete grows in popularity as a building material and its aesthetic treatment is better understood.",
        "Concrete pavings are being used in buildings of first importance, the aggregate being very carefully selected, and in many cases the whole mixture coloured by the use of pigments.",
        "One of the great objections to the appearance of concrete is the fact that soon after its erection irregular cracks invariably appear on its surface.",
        "In the case of a smooth concrete face there are no joints to follow, and the cracks become an ugly feature.",
        "A pleasing \"rough\" appearance can be given to concrete by brushing it over soon after it has set with a stiff brush dipped in water or dilute acid.",
        "At one time Portland cement concrete was considered to be lacking in fireproof qualities, but now it is regarded as one of the best fire-resisting materials known.",
        "Although experi ments on this matter are badly needed, there is little Y doubt that good steel concrete is very nearly indestruc- tire.",
        "But they are weak, and modern experience goes to show that a strong concrete is the best, and that probably materials like broken clamp bricks or burnt clay, which are porous and yet strong, are far better than cinders as a fireproof aggregate.",
        "The steel reinforcement is of immense importance in fireproof work, because, if properly designed, it enables the concrete to hold together and do its work even when it has been cracked by fire and water.",
        "On the other hand, the concrete, being a non-conductor, preserves the steel from being softened and twisted by excessive temperature.",
        "and foundations concrete is nearly always cheaper than brickwork or masonry.",
        "On the other hand, for reasons already given, thin walls, such as house walls, will cost more in concrete.",
        "There are many varieties of concrete known as \"artificial stones\" which can now be bought ready moulded into the form of paving slabs, wall blocks and pipes: they are both pleasing in appearance and very durable, being carefully made by skilled workmen.",
        "The introduction of steel concrete (also known as ferroconcrete, armoured concrete, or reinforced concrete) is generally attributed to Joseph Monier, a French gardener, who about the year 1868 was anxious to build some concrete water basins.",
        "The important point of his idea was that it combined steel and concrete in such a way that the best qualities of each material were brought into play.",
        "Concrete is readily procured and easily moulded into shape.",
        "But it is difficult and expensive to work up into various forms. Concrete has been avoided for making beams, slabs and thin walls, just because its deficiency in tensile strength doomed it to failure in such structures.",
        "Thus the one point of weakness in the concrete slab is overcome by the addition of steel in its simplest form, and both materials are used to their best advantage.",
        "The scientific and practical value of this idea was soon seized upon by various inventors and others, and the number of patented systems of combining steel with concrete is constantly increasing.",
        "The majority of these systems have emanated from France, where steel concrete is largely used.",
        "The concrete itself should always be the very best quality, and Portland cement should be used on account of its superiority to all others.",
        "The proportions generally used are 4 to I and 5 to I in the case of gravel concrete, or 4 or I:22: 6 in the case of broken stone concrete.",
        "But, generally speaking, in steel concrete the cost of the cement is but a small item of the whole expense, and it is worth while to be generous with it.",
        "The mixing and laying should all be done very thoroughly; the concrete should be rammed in position, and any old surface of concrete which has to be covered should be cleaned and coated with fresh cement.",
        "At first it was feared that such bars would have a tendency to slip through the concrete in which they were embedded, but experiments have shown that if the bar is not painted but has a natural rusty surface a very considerable adhesion between the concrete and steel - as much as 2 cwt.",
        "Many devices are used, however, to ensure the adhesion between concrete and bar being perfect.",
        "The structures in which steel concrete is used may be analysed as consisting essentially of (I) walls, (2) columns, (3) piles, (4) beams, (5) slabs, (6) arches.",
        "The steel reinforcement is generally applied in the form of vertical rods built in the wall at intervals, with lighter horizontal rods which cross the vertical ones, and thus form a network of steel which is buried in the concrete.",

        "In the Cottancin system the concrete is replaced by bricks pierced with holes through which the vertical rods are threaded; the horizontal tie-rods are also used, but these do not merely cross the vertical ones, but are woven in and out of them.",
        "That steel concrete can be used for piles is perhaps the most astonishing feature in this invention.",
        "The fact that a comparatively brittle material like concrete can be subjected not only to heavy loads but also to the jar and vibration from the blows of a heavy pile ram makes it appear as if its nature and properties had been changed by the steel reinforcement.",
        "Considere's ex periments have shown that concrete when reinforced is capable of being stretched, without fracture, about twenty times as much as plain concrete.",
        "The sawdust adapts it self to the rough shape of the concrete, and deadens the blow to some extent.",
        "But it is in the design of steel concrete beams that the greatest ingenuity has been shown, and almost every patentee of a \"system\" has some new device for arranging the steel reinforcement to the best advantage.",
        "Concrete by itself, though strong in compression, can offer but little resistance to tensile and shearing stresses, and as these stresses always occur in beams the problem arises how best to arrange the steel so as to assist the concrete in bearing them.",
        "They are exceedingly thin, but being buried in concrete no danger of their perishing from rust is to be feared.",
        "But in a thin slab, with its comparatively small span and light load, the concrete is generally strong enough to bear the shearing stresses unaided, and the reinforcement is devoted to assisting it where the tensile stresses occur.",

        "In the Matrai system thin wires are used instead of rods, and are securely fastened to rolled steel joists, which form the beams on which the slabs rest; moreover, the wires instead of being stretched tight from side to side of the slab are allowed to sag as much as the thickness of the concrete will allow.",
