        "\"I think we should see The Lucky Pup Mine for ourselves,\" Cynthia said.",
        "Dean glanced up, trying to catch his breath and spotted the mine portal before them.",

        "While he was pleased that Bird Song was starting the day on a pleasant note, the knot in his stomach remained to remind him of their pending trip to the mine.",
        "Do you think he was the one who switched our markings in the mine?",
        "The Deans, while making no comment on the discovery, realized this was how someone could have entered the mine and altered their markings while they were inside.",
        "\"Even if it was any good,\" Harold added, \"the mine's too far up to haul anything down.\"",
        "The mine was sealed up for years.",
        "Here, have a sip of mine.",
        "Just drive mine for a while.",
        "What was once mine is now ours.",
        "Tomorrow, she's mine, Memon ordered, and rose.",
        "For a number of years, however, the mine has been suffered to remain untouched, as the deposits originally worked were found to be depleted.",
        "If, for example, we assume the life of a given mine at ten years and the rate of interest at 5%, it will be necessary that the property shall earn nearly 13% annually - viz., 5% interest and 8% for the annual payment to the amortization or the reserve fund.",
        "In many instances, indeed, profits are more or less uncertain during the whole life of the mine, and it is evident that the value of the mining property must be more or less speculative.",
        "The mine workings may also be flooded Flooding of by large bodies of underground water.",
        "Finally Gentz's diaries, from 1800 to 1828, an invaluable mine of authentic material, were edited by Varnhagen von Ense and published after his death under the title Tagebiicher, &c. (Leipzig, 1861; new ed., 4 vols., ib.",
        "The right to mine for rubies by European methods and to levy royalties from persons working by native methods was leased to the Burma Ruby Mines Company, Limited, in 1889, and the lease was renewed in 1896 for 14 years at a rent of Rs.3,15,000 a year plus a share of the profits.",
        "To provide for the repayment from earnings of the capital invested in a mining property and expended in development, and to provide for the depreciation in value of the plant and equipment, an amortization fund must be accumulated during the life of the mine; or, if it be desired to continue the business of mining elsewhere, a similar fund must be created for the purchase, development and equipment of a new property to take the place of the original deposit when that shall be exhausted.",
        "Assuming, for example, the life of the mine at ten years as before, and taking the interest to be earned by the amortization fund at 3%, and that on the investment at io%, we shall find that the annual income should amount to 18.7% per year.",
        "These simple business principles do not seem to be generally recognized by the investing public, and mines, whose earning capacity is accurately known, are frequently quoted on the stock markets at prices which cannot possibly yield enough to the purchaser to repay his investment during the probable life of the mine.",
        "What business was it of mine when I married and was so deep in debt that I was threatened with prison, and had a mother who could not see or understand it?",
        "\"And mine,\" Jule said and materialized with two others.",
        "I don't give a damn about a bunch of bones, but where do you get off saying The Lucky Pup Mine is yours?",
        "The moon will not sour milk nor taint meat of mine, nor will the sun injure my furniture or fade my carpet; and if he is sometimes too warm a friend, I find it still better economy to retreat behind some curtain which nature has provided, than to add a single item to the details of housekeeping.",
        "Mine was, as it were, the connecting link between wild and cultivated fields; as some states are civilized, and others half-civilized, and others savage or barbarous, so my field was, though not in a bad sense, a half-cultivated field.",
        "Or being upset because someone else's borzoi and not mine catches something.",
        "\"The one in pink is mine, so keep off!\" said Ilyin on seeing Dunyasha running resolutely toward him.",
        "The day advanced as if to light some work of mine; it was morning, and lo, now it is evening, and nothing memorable is accomplished.",
        "I love to have mine before my window, and the more chips the better to remind me of my pleasing work.",
        "You think the boy might not be mine?",
        "I want a fwower on mine.",
        "I thought I was marrying a man who had chosen a lifestyle compatible with mine.",
        "No. There are homes in the area far less secure than mine.",
        "She turned to me, her face only inches from mine.",
        "Humphries is out of the system, according to a friend of mine.",
        "Just place your hand on top of mine.",
        "You really are mine.",
        "I only see other people's fates, not mine.",
        "Which one of you is mine?",
        "The ones where you tell me you're mine.",
        "If you choose not to take it, it's your decision, not mine.",
        "I see your thoughts like mine.",
        "Yours will remain right beside mine.",
        "'Cause I kept having dreams about the dead guy in the mine.",
        "David is going to find out who the guy in the mine is.",
        "It could be a gold mine.",
        "I'd have been shocked if he didn't take his sweet time going up to the mine.",
        "First off, I'm going to find out who owns that mine.",
        "One of the ladies who worked at the courthouse made an offhand comment about the popular Lucky Pup Mine.",
        "Mr. Dean here, part time detective and sheriff candidate, tracked down a hot lead on some bones—maybe a long dead villain—up at The Lucky Pup mine.",
        "I own The Lucky Pup mine.",
        "Let's hear your reasoning—then I'll tell you mine.",
        "They were too busy distrusting one another and, for whatever reason, trying to con the other out of the mine.",
        "He might not have known whose trail out of the tunnel he was sabotaging—just some trespasser in his precious mine.",
        "Dean considered his poking options as he used half a cake of soap to scrub away the stink of the mine.",
        "Dawkins owns that mine!",
        "Just like we were skirting the trespass law by poking around the mine.",
        "What's so valuable about the Lucky Pup Mine?",
        "He held up the small white bone he'd found at the mine.",
        "It was found in a mine.",
        "The time frame was right for it to be the body of Senior Dawkins's mine manager, slain there in 1961.",
        "Twenty-four hours after his hour-long downhill hike from the mine, Dean's stilts felt like he'd run a barefoot marathon on cobblestoned streets.",
        "It was the first real words the two had exchanged since their meeting at the mine.",
        "Or whoever's ass ends up owning the mine, Dean thought, but he simply waved away the apology.",
        "We had no business up at the mine.",
        "If there were remains of a man in that mine, I would think you'd want to know who he was.",
        "After all, someone tried to get us lost in that mine and sabotaged our Jeep.",
        "In the eyes of the Deans, it was looking more and more as if person or persons unknown did in fact take the original bones and switch them for the theatrical imitations Fitzgerald dragged out of The Lucky Pup mine.",
        "Cynthia Dean, in hoping for further confirmation that the bones had been switched, tried to contact the parents of Caleb Jones, Martha's friend who was with her in the mine.",
        "At least Dean had refrained from disclosing the tie to the Dawkinses—Josh, the missing mine manager—nor had he mentioned he knew the name of the Dawkinses' stepmother.",
        "It wouldn't be very smart to leave the body in your own mine property.",
        "But he's far too young to have had any involvement with the Dawkinses, the mine, or the skeleton.",
        "Someone had a campfire and it looked as if the door on the mine was used for fire wood.",
        "Let's say the mine was closed up for years and only recently broken into.",
        "They'd broken into the mine.",
        "Or, sweet Edith wasn't so sweet and bashed Josh's head in and left him in the mine.",
        "A little girl—a sort-of ward of ours—had an interest in the Lucky Pup Mine.",
        "I guess he had some bucks at one time—back when he bought all this land—but his bank account never held a candle to mine.",
        "Did Paul ever talk about working a mine up there?",
        "What are the odds of her meeting this guy and being the daughter of his mine manager from twenty years earlier and a thousand miles away?",
        "Long pants or grubby clothes weren't necessary, as Dean had no intention of entering the mine.",
        "More importantly, Dean now realized that the only real evidence that the remains from the mine were human had disappeared.",
        "There's a woman whose husband owned the land where the mine is located and she may know something helpful, Dean told her.",
        "They'd been in the mine for forty years.",
        "They drove south from town and in less than a quarter mile, turned right onto what was locally known as the Camp Bird Mine Road.",
        "\"I'll print you copies of mine if you run out,\" Cynthia said.",
        "After what seemed even longer than the Dean's first trip to the mine just two days earlier, they emerged into the basin where the valley floor was a sea of wildflowers.",
        "Where's the mine that everyone is so concerned about?",
        "Is someone in the mine, do you suppose?",
        "Did you go in the mine?",
        "It's private land, not national forest or park lands, and even though you or the Dawkinses own all this, it's not posted, except for the mine tunnel.",
        "The mine was sealed, a new metal door and padlock in place where the gaping opening had welcomed the Deans two days before.",
        "\"Don't get us lost,\" Cynthia cautioned as the trio began the climb downward, away from the mine.",
        "It was a mine portal, smaller than the main entrance to the Lucky Pup.",
        "Not one of the threesome had a desire to enter the mine via this newfound entrance, but each cautiously examined the portal.",
        "The portal was smaller and dryer than the main mine entrance and seemed to lead downward from this elevated location.",
        "After they were settled in the vehicle and on their way back to town, Jennifer Radisson brought up the more mundane subjects of the mine and her litigation.",
        "\"Do you think the fact that the skeleton was in the mine is the reason my brothers-in-law want the property so badly?\" she asked.",
        "We based the age on when the ownership of the mine changed hands and when it was last worked.",
        "The Lucky Pup has apparently been sealed up for the last forty years until someone—kids, we think—broke into the mine this spring.",
        "He filled Fred in on meeting Jennifer Radisson, their afternoon trip to the mine, and the discovery of a back entrance.",
        "And don't you dare go in that mine!",
        "He gave only a glance up the path to the mine before returning to his Jeep.",
        "He wiped his prints and replaced it, wondering if Joseph or Ginger Dawkins was responsible for the gunshot at the mine.",
        "Besides, it's her word against mine.",
        "\"The liquor bottle outside the Lucky Pup mine was a pint of vodka, too,\" Cynthia said.",
        "That supports the suspicion that Billy and some of his friends were the ones who broke into the mine and first discovered the bones.",
        "Do you think it was he who shot at us up at the mine?",
        "I suppose it's an offer on the mine.",
        "He may have worked up at The Lucky Pup Mine.",
        "Most of 'em worked the Idarado Mine.",
        "A man named Dawkins bought the mine from the Rowland estate.",
        "Then why would the heirs think the mine was so valuable to go to court over it?",
        "The mine's like a thousand other holes in the ground—it's outlived its time.",
        "I understand from Dawkins' son his old man was paying Josh pretty well to be his mine manager—up until August of 1961 when Josh disappeared.",
        "Josh salted that mine and strung along the owner just enough to get a salary out of him.",
        "Dawkins, Sr. had never hired another mine manager after Josh and never so much as mentioned the Lucky Pup after that time—to his sons or his wife.",
        "Either one of them might have stolen the bony digit from Cynthia's jewelry case and fired a gun at the Lucky Pup Mine.",
        "Certainly he has no ties to Josh Mulligan of forty years ago, or the Dawkins, or the Lucky Pup mine.",
        "He also withheld the identity of Josh, Dawkins Sr.'s mine manager, and the fact that someone fired a gun at the mine.",
        "But there was the little problem of the pack of cigarettes Martha clearly described as being with the bones in the Lucky Pup Mine.",
        "But if he planted a bottle in Billy's vehicle after the accident, it's his word against mine the alcohol wasn't there at the time of the accident.",
        "Josh Mulligan was Paul's mine manager at the Lucky Pup.",
        "I don't know whose bones were in the Lucky Pup Mine, but Josh Mulligan died in 1987 of cirrhosis of the liver from drinking too much.",
        "\"But the mine was worked in the sixties,\" Cynthia said.",
        "It was our assumption that the mine was being worked in the sixties.",
        "We dated the bones in the sixties based on circumstances—when we thought the mine was being worked and when it was sealed.",
        "But the mine has a second entrance.",
        "He rose to leave and then added, Whatever the age of that skeleton, the facts still remain that someone swapped the bones, someone stole the finger and 'metalman29' was offering an inflated price for the mine.",
        "Then he added, You might have better luck learning who's been trying to buy the worthless mine and who at Bird Song swiped the itsy-bitsy bone you found.",
        "They moved on to anyone involved with the mine property.",
        "There's a chance the offer for the mine was completely innocent—simply someone who was legitimately interested in The Lucky Pup and then changed his mind.",
        "After much discussion, they agreed on the wording: I understand you have an interest in the Lucky Pup mine in Ouray County, Colorado and may be anxious about what was found therein.",
        "Eyes widened when she learned someone had pilfered the small finger bone from Cynthia's bureau and she shivered when told the Deans had been followed into the mine.",
        "She turned to the right, up the unpaved Camp Bird Mine Road.",
        "It would end where it began—at the Lucky Pup Mine.",
        "The tracks of the vehicle that preceded him were clear in the dust of the turnoff, and he knew he'd guessed correctly as he neared the now-familiar meadow below the mine.",
        "His wife motioned toward the mine entrance out of sight in the rocks and trees.",
        "He has a key to the mine gate.",
        "He wanted us to go into the mine with him but when he saw you coming he went up alone.",
        "\"Something that happened long, long time ago,\" Dean said as he turned toward the mine.",
        "I told her about the back entrance to the mine.",
        "When I called Billy to tell him I was coming out this summer, he mentioned he'd found some old bones in a mine but he was afraid of getting in trouble for breaking in.",
        "Yes. But the mine was all tied up in litigation.",
        "How did you locate the skeleton in the mine to be able to swap it?",
        "By that time, the mine was open anyway, so going in there wasn't breaking and entering.",
        "Weren't you afraid Billy would know what he saw wasn't the fake bones Fitzgerald brought out of the mine?",
        "He told us there was gold in the mine.",
        "We marked the way out of the mine but then he showed us he'd picked up our markings.",
        "It was safer to leave him in the mine.",
        "Why go back into the mine after all these years and take the chance of swapping the bones and getting caught?",
        "Fred O'Connor seemed a tad put out that he'd been absent from the final confrontation in the Lucky Pup Mine until Dean reminded him that without his Internet connection and library research, Martha's bones would still be without identity.",
        "\"I think Dawkins found the back entrance to the mine and thought we were kids poking around in there, so he switched our markings,\" he told his wife.",
        "When told of the happenings at her mine, she said she would consider changing its name—it hadn't been \"lucky\" for anyone.",
        "Not by mine directly.",
        "\"They're mine, Gabriel,\" she retorted.",
        "Everything that's mine is yours.",
        "\"Let the girl go, and I'll make sure your soul goes where it should, right beside mine,\" Deidre added, carefully wording the deal.",
        "I hope your week was better than mine.",
        "You have a list of enemies longer than mine, and he's obligated to protect you.",
        "Neither your domain nor mine.",
        "Mine, not my predecessor's.",
        "Your secret for mine?",
        "If you can't do what I did in a week, he's mine.",
        "\"Not mine,\" she said.",
        "\"He's not mine!\" she insisted, unable to break away from the mob.",
        "\"You have something that's mine, brother,\" came the familiar, low growl.",
        "The girl is mine.",
        "His problem, not mine.",
        "And this is mine?",
        "\"By all rights, you should've been mine!\" he snarled in a low growl.",
        "No one hurts what's mine.",
        "You.re already mine.",
        "Mine are on the way.",
        "\"As are mine,\" Erik said.",
        "\"We lost half of Kris.s warriors and quite a few of mine,\" Kiki said.",
        "I want to explore mine first!",
        "His father may have betrayed mine, but he has been loyal for all these years we've been exiled.",
        "\"No, it was mostly mine,\" she said.",
        "I must protect them and ensure their honor and mine remains intact.",
        "You must miss your home as I do mine.",
        "Mansr closed the door as another mine exploded and guided the spacecraft farther off the ground.",
        "I thought they might be auburn, like mine.",
        "You and Mrs. Dean are sort of like pals of mine, you know?",
        "If she lives on in my sister's mind one way, and in mine another, what's the harm in that?",
        "They say a blast at the Wanaka mine killed two.",
        "She'll think the child is mine!",
        "I don't know if she is aware of our arrangement as few words ever pass between us, but her quarters are far from mine and we will be ever so quiet in our love.",
        "At least it looks like mine.",
        "You see, when you die, you have your heaven and I have mine.",
        "He said, \"They are mine, they are personal and I will choose with whom to share them.\"",
        "Emily would reprimand him, \"No brother of mine will act like a savage.\"",
        "Show me yours and I'll show you mine.",
        "Ah, but you see, she is the one who stole mine.",
        "\"You know,\" she continued as she scooped grain into a stanchion, \"it really galls me that Josh is always encouraging Lori with her work, but he never misses an opportunity to belittle mine.",

        "Conditions affecting the cost of opening, developing and working the mine or determining the methods to be adopted.",
        "The mistake is often made of sinking large and expensive shafts, or driving costly tunnels, before it is fully proved that the deposit can be worked on a scale to warrant such developments, and, indeed, too often before it is known that the deposit can be worked at all; and in too many cases large amounts of money are thus unnecessarily lost by over-sanguine mine managers.",
        "As soon as it appears reasonably certain that the property is workable the mine will be opened by one or more shafts, drifts or tunnels, and the underground passages for active mining operations will be started.",
        "Either may be used for drainage of the mine workings, in which case it becomes an adit.",
        "A mine should always be opened by drift or entry if practicable, as thereby the expense of hoisting and pumping is avoided.",
        "When, however, the deposit lies below the surface the mine must be opened by a shaft.",
        "As the mine is opened the deposit is subdivided into blocks of convenient size by parallel passages, which form later the main haulage roads, and by transverse openings for ventilation.",
        "A mine, however, may be over-developed, which results in loss of interest on the capital unnecessarily locked up for years by excessive development, and involves additional cost for the maintenance of such openings until they are needed for active mining operations.",
        "When the development of a mine has advanced sufficiently the operation of working or extracting the mineral begins.",
        "The safety of the men must be one of the first considerations of the mine operator.",

        "4 is a portion of a mine which consists of a series of irregular chambers with the roof supported on small pillars left at intervals for the purpose.",
        "It is not desirable to leave large areas standing upon pillars in the mine, and as soon as the work on any level is completed the pillar below should be mined out as far as is safe, and the abandoned portion of the mine allowed to cave in and lessen the weight on the pillars elsewhere.",
        "The cost of filling has been greatly reduced by the system of flushing culm, sand, gravel and similar material, through pipes leading from the surface into mine workings.",
        "The excavated material is brought to the hoisting shaft, or sometimes directly to the surface, in small mine cars, moved by men or by animals, or by locomotives or wire-rope haulage.",
        "The size, shape and design of the cars depend on the size of the mine passage and of the hoisting compartments of the shafts; on whether the cars are to be trammed by hand or hauled in trains; whether they are loaded by shovel or by gravity from a chute; and whether they are to be hoisted to the surface or used only for underground transport.",
        "Mine cars are sometimes run long distances, singly or in trains, over roads which are given sufficient grade to impart considerable speed by gravity, say from I to 21%.",
        "By using compressed air vitiation of the mine air is avoided, as well as all danger of fire or explosion of gas.",

        "For short periods the mineral may remain in the mine cars, or may be loaded into railway wagons held at the mine for this purpose.",
        "Cars, however, are too valuable to be used in this way for more than a few hours, and it is usual to erect large storage bins at the mine, at concentration works and metallurgical establishments, in which the mineral may be stored, permitting cars, wagons and vessels to be quickly emptied or loaded.",
        "657.) Mine Drainage.",
        "- A mine which has been opened by an adit tunnel or drift drains itself, so far as the workings above the adit level are concerned.",
        "In driving mine passages thatj are to be used for drainage, care is taken to maintain sufficient gradient.",
        "As the larger part of the water in a mine comes from the surface, the cost of drainage may be reduced by intercepting this surface water, and collecting it at convenient points in the pump shaft from which it may be raised at less cost than if permitted to go to the bottom.",
        "Mine pumps are of two classes: (I) those in which the driving engine is on the surface and operates the pumps by a long line of rods passing down the shaft, commonly known as the Cornish system; (2) direct-acting pumps, in which the engine and pumping cylinders form a single unit, placed close to the point underground from which the water is to be raised.",
        "Mine pumps of ordinary forms may be operated by compressed air, and air-lift pumps have been successfully employed.",
        "Centrifugal pumps, constructed with several stages or sets of vanes, and suitable for high lifts, have been introduced for mine service.",
        "When mine water is acid the working parts of the pump must be lined with or made of bronze or other non-corrosive material; or the acid may be neutralized by adding lime in the sump.",
        "The air of a mine is vitiated by the presence of large numbers of men and animals and of numerous lights, each of which may consume as much air as a number of men.",
        "In addition to these sources of contamination the air of the mine is frequently charged with gas issuing from the rocks or from the mineral deposit.",
        "The ventilation of a mine must in general be produced artificially.",
        "In any case whether natural or artificial means be employed, a mine can only be ventilated properly when it has at least two distinct openings to the surface, one an intake or \" downcast,\" the other a chimney serving as an \" upcast.\"",
        "If the two openings to the mine are at different levels the difference in weight of the inside and outside air due to difference in temperature causes a current, and in the winter months large volumes of air will be circulated through the mine from this cause alone.",
        "In a mine with shafts opening at the same level, natural ventilation once established will be effective during cold weather, as the downcast will have the temperature of the outside air, while the upcast will be filled with the warm air of the mine.",
        "In a mine with two shafts a ventilating current may result from other conditions creating a difference in the temperature of the air in either shaft - for example, the cooling effect of dropping water or the heating effect of steam pipes.",
        "Ventilation may be produced by heating the air of the mine, as for example, by constructing a ventilating furnace at the bottom of an air shaft.",
        "The efficiency of such ventilating furnaces is low, and they cannot safely be used in mines producing fire-damp. They are sometimes the cause of underground fires, and they are always a source of danger when by any chance the ventilating current becomes reversed, in which case the products of combustion, containing large quantities of carbon dioxide, will be drawn into the mine to the serious danger of the men.",
        "The typical mine fan consists of a shaft upon which are mounted a number of vanes enclosed in a casing; the air entering a central side inlet is caught up by the revolving vanes and thrown out at the periphery by the centrifugal force thus generated.",
        "The inlet opening of the pressure fan is in free communication with the outside air, the discharge connecting with the mine air-way; in the more generally used exhaust fan the inlet is connected with the airway, the fan discharging into the atmosphere.",
        "Opposed to the motive force producing the air current is the frictional resistance developed in passing through the mine workings.",
        "A certain pressure of air is required to maintain circulation against the resistance, and for a given volume per minute the smaller and more irregular the mine openings the greater must be the pressure.",
        "The power required to circulate the air through a mine increases as the cube of the velocity of the air current.",
        "To decrease the velocity, when large volumes of air are required, the air passages are made larger, and the mine is divided into sections and the air current subdivided into a corresponding number of independent circuits.",
        "The circulation of air in any given division of the mine is further controlled and its course determined by temporary or permanent partitions, known as brattices, by the erection of stoppings, or by the insertion of doors in the mine passages and by the use of special airways.",
        "So far as possible, vitiated air is led directly to the shaft instead of passing through other workings; for example, mine stables when used are placed near the upcast shaft and ventilated by an independent split of the ventilating current.",
        "The deepest mine in the world is No.",
        "3 shaft of the Tamarack mine in Houghton county, Michigan, which has reached a vertical depth of about 5200 ft.",
        "Three other shafts of the Tamarack Company, and three of the neighbouring Calumet and Hecla mine, have depths of between 4000 and 5000 ft.",
        "The Quincy mine, also in Houghton county, has reached a vertical depth of nearly 4000 ft.",
        "This condition manifests itself, for example, in mine pillars which are subjected to a weight beyond the limit of elasticity of the mineral of which they are composed.",
        "and less some of the softer rocks show a tendency to flow, as exhibited by the under-clay in deep coal-mines, which not infrequently swells up and closes the mine passages.",
        "Similar swelling ground is not infrequently met with in metal mines, as, for example, in the Phoenix copper mine in Houghton county, Michigan, where the force developed was sufficient to crush the strongest timber that could be used.",
        "wide for a length of zoo ft., throwing men and mine cars violently against the roof and producing an air-wave which smashed the mine doors in the vicinity.",
        "In addition mining operations are subject to interruption and added expense from explosions, mine fires, flooding, and the caving-in of the workings.",
        "In the case of a developed mine its life may be predicted in many cases with absolute certainty - as when the extent of the mineral deposit and the volume of mineral can be measured.",
        "In other cases the life of the mine, like the value of the mineral, is more or less uncertain.",
        "The valuation of mines then involves the following steps: (1) The sampling of the deposit so far as developed, and assaying of the samples taken; (2) The measurement of the developed ore; (3) estimates of the probable amount of ore in the undeveloped part of the property; (4) estimates of probable profits, life of the mine, and determination of the value of the property.",
        "Where the deposit is a regular one and the mineral is of fairly uniform richness, the taking of a few samples from widely separated parts of the mine will often furnish sufficient data to determine the value of the deposit.",
        "The sampling of a large mine of this character may cost many hundreds of pounds.",
        "In order to determine the probable profit and life of the mine a definite scale of operations must be assumed, the money required for development and plant and for working capital must be estimated, the methods of mining and treating the ore determined, and their probable cost estimated.",
        "As will be seen from this diagram the most serious source of death and injury is not found in mine explosions, but in the fall of rocks and mineral in the working places.",
        "Fire-damp and dust explosions are caused by the presence of marsh-gas in sufficient quantity to form an explosive mixture, or by a mixture of small percentages of marsh-gas and coal-dust, and in some cases by the presence of coal-dust alone in the air of the mine.",
        "Mine fires may originate from ordinary causes, but in addition they may result from the explosion of fire-damp or from the accidental lighting of jets of fire-damp issuing from the coal.",

        "At first a fall of the roof occurs locally, here and there throughout the mine, and these falls may succeed one another until the settlement of portions of the roof has so far relieved the strain that the remaining areas are supported by the stronger pillars, and by the fallen rock masses.",
        "The caving-in of the mine, however, is rarely so complete that avenues of escape are not open.",
        "In many cases, however, it has been found necessary to reopen the mine through the fallen ground, and even to excavate openings through the solid mineral.",
