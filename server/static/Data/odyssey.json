It may be answered, however, that much of this is traditional, handed down from the time when all poetry was unwritten.",
        "The result of these various considerations seems to be that the age which we may call the Homeric - the age which is brought before us in vivid outlines in the Iliad and Odyssey - lies beyond the earliest point to which history enables us to penetrate.",
        "The use of that dialect (instead of Aeolic) by the Boeotian poet Hesiod, in a kind of poetry which was not of the Homeric type, tends to the conclusion that the literary ascendancy of the epic dialect was anterior to the Iliad and Odyssey, and independent of the influence exercised by these poems.",

        "Wolf had argued that if the cyclic writers had known the Iliad and Odyssey which we possess, they would have imitated the unity of structure which distinguishes these two poems. The result of Welcker's labours was to show that the Homeric poems had influenced both the form and the substance of epic poetry.",
        "In this way there arose a conservative school who admitted more or less freely the absorption of pre-existing lays in the formation of the Iliad and Odyssey, and also the existence of considerable interpolations, but assigned the main work of formation to prehistoric times, and to the genius of a great poet.",

        "The passages in the second half of the Odyssey which describe the appearance of Ulysses do not give two wellmarked representations of him.",
        "Kirchhoff argues that the Artacia of the Argonautic story must have been taken from the real Artacia, and the Artacia of the Odyssey again from that of the Argonautic story.",
        "Or it may be that the Artacia of the Odyssey suggested the name to the colonists of Cyzicus, whence it was adopted into the later versions of the Argonautic story.",
        "It does not indeed follow that the Odyssey is free from interpolations.",
        "But the unity of the Odyssey as a whole is apparently beyond the reach of the existing weapons of criticism.",
        "For instance, the word 4 6/30s, which in Homer means \" flight in battle \" (not \" fear \"), occurs thirty-nine times in the Iliad, and only once in the Odyssey; but then there are no battles in the Odyssey.",
        "Again, the verb p7)yvvp., \" to break,\" occurs forty-eight times in the Iliad, and once in the Odyssey, - the reason being that it is constantly used of breaking the armour of an enemy, the gate of a city, the hostile ranks, &c. Once more, the word aKOTos, \" darkness,\" occurs fourteen times in the Iliad, once in the Odyssey.",
        "On the other side, if words such as &aµcvOos, \" a bath,\" XEpvc 1 G, \" a basin for the hands,\" XEaxn, \" a place to meet and talk,\" &c., are peculiar to the Odyssey, we have only to remember that the scene in the Iliad is hardly ever laid within any walls except those of a tent.",
        "The Odyssey, on the contrary, is full of the magical and romantic - \" speciosa miracula,\" as Horace called them.",
        "Moreover, these marvels - which in their original form are doubtless as old as anything in the Iliad, since in fact they are part of the vast stock of popular tales (Mdrehen) diffused all over the world - are mixed up in the Odyssey with the heroes of the Trojan war.",
        "The question then is - How long must the name of Ulysses have been familiar in the legend (Sage) of Troy before it made its way into the tales of giants and ogres (Mdrehen), where the poet of the Odyssey found it ?",
        "Again, the Trojan legend has itself received some extension between the time of the Iliad and that of the Odyssey.",
        "Between the Iliad and these poets the Odyssey often occupies an intermediate position.",
        "These differences bear out the inference that the Odyssey is of a later age.",
        "The singer, too, who is so prominent a figure in the Odyssey can hardly be thought to be absent from the Iliad merely because the scene is laid in a camp.",
        "The Odyssey is in this respect perceptibly below the level of the Iliad.",
        "1 But while we are on our guard against a once common error, we may recognize the historical connexion between the Iliad and Odyssey and the \" ballad \" literature which undoubtedly preceded them in Greece.",
        "But between these lays and Homer we must place the cultivation of epic poetry as an art.2 The pre-Homeric lays doubtless furnished the elements of such a poetry - the alphabet, so to speak, of the art; but they must have been refined and transmuted before they formed poems like the Iliad and Odyssey.",
        "It seems clear, however, that the hypothesis of epics such as the Iliad and Odyssey having been formed by putting together or even by working up shorter poems finds no support from analogy.",
        "noticed above between the Iliad and the Odyssey, and between Homer and the early Cyclic poems. And the peculiar degradation of Homeric characters which appears in some poets (especially Euripides) finds a parallel in the later chansons de geste.3 The comparison of Homer with the great literary epics calls for more discursive treatment than would be in place here.",
