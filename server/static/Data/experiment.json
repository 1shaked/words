        "In July 1808 Davy laid a request before the managers of the Royal Institution that they would set on foot a subscription for the purchase of a specially large voltaic battery; as a result he was provided with one of 2000 pairs of plates, and the first experiment performed with it was the production of the electric arc light between carbon poles.",
        "2 This experiment was repeated in a variety of forms by A.",
        "One form which this experiment took was that of rotating a copper disk between the poles of a powerful electric magnet.",
        "He discovered a function, which has been called the potential of one circuit on another, from which he deduced a theory of induction, completely in accordance with experiment.",
        "It is, he says, the procedure from one experiment to another, and it is not a science but an art or learned sagacity (resembling in this Aristotle's lyxivoca), which may, however, be enlightened by the precepts of the Interpretatio.",
        "The only modification of water-retting which has hitherto endured the test of prolonged experiment, and taken a firm position as a distinct improvement, is the warm-water retting patented in England in 1846 by an American, Robert B.",
        "The Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland, and the Belfast Flax Supply Association, have jointly made some experiments with this method, and the following extract from the Association's report for 1905 shows the success which attended their efforts: \" By desire of the department (which has taken up the position of an impartial critic of the experiment) a quantity of flax straw was divided into two equal lots.",
        "An experiment made by Professor Hodges of Belfast on 7770 lb of air-dried flax yielded the following results.",
        "Snow-Harris found that this charge varied as the square root of the weight in the opposite pan, thus showing that the 1 It is probable that an experiment of this kind had been made as far back as 1746 by Daniel Gralath, of Danzig, who has some claims to have suggested the word \" electrometer \" in connexion with it.",
        "His master, Buraeus, had written a few Swedish hexameters by way of experiment.",
        "He did not live to put his method into practice; but this was done by Henry Cavendish, who made, by means of Michell's apparatus, the celebrated determination that now goes by the name of Cavendish's experiment (Phil.",
        "Although the emperor's experiment was short-lived podestas soon became general in northern Italy, making their appearance in most communes about 1200.",
        "The experiment by which Hoek conclusively proved the change of sex in the oyster was as follows.",
        "Until 1899 all the customs were farmed out (1898-1899 for 300,000),, but in March of that year the farm system was abolished in the two provinces of Azerbaijan and Kermgnshh, and, the experiment there proving successful, in all other provinces in the following year.",
        "The twist or surface-shear being proportional to the torque, the horse-power can be calculated if the modulus of rigidity of the steel employed is known or if the amount of twist corresponding to a given power has previously been ascertained by direct experiment on the shaft before it has been put in place.",
        "The testing of ideas by observation and experiment which was begun in anatomy by Vesalius.",
        "If a horse be chosen for the experiment, a considerable quantity of blood may be withdrawn without injuring the animal.",
        "BROOK FARM, the name applied to a tract of land in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, on which in 1841-1847 a communistic experiment was unsuccessfully tried.",
        "The experiment was one of the practical manifestations of the spirit of \"Transcendentalism,\" in New England, though many of the more prominent transcendentalists took no direct part in it.",
        "The experiment was abandoned in the autumn of 1847.",
        "Indirectly connected with the experiment, also, as visitors for longer or shorter periods but never as regular members, were Emerson, Amos Bronson Alcott, Orestes A.",
        "The experiment failed, and only two cottages now remain as curiosities.",
        "An agricultural experiment station is maintained here by the Cuban government.",
        "Under his rule the experiment was fairly successful, but the married colonists afterwards became a privileged caste, subsisting upon the labour of their slaves, and often disloyal to their rulers.",

        "We may regard it as a physical fact established by experiment in the same way as the laws of the elasticity of solid bodies.",
        "In like manner we may by experiment ascertain the general fact that the surface of a liquid is in a state of tension similar to that of a membrane stretched equally in all directions, and prove that this tension depends only on the nature and temperature of the liquid and not on its form, and from this as a secondary physical principle we may deduce all the phenomena of capillary action.",
        "In both theories the equation of the liquid surface is the same, involving a constant H, which can be determined only by experiment.",
        "It is found by experiment that it is only very close to the bounding surface of a liquid that the forces arising from the mutual action of its parts have any resultant effect on one of its particles.",
        "As an experiment on the angle of contact only gives us the difference of the surface-tensions at the solid surface, we cannot determine their actual value.",
        "So far the results of Laplace's hypothesis are in marked accordance with experiment; but if we follow it out further, discordances begin to manifestthemselves.",
